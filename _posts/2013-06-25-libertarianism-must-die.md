I work with some of the smartest people I’ve ever known, all of us doing our best to advance the cause of human liberty. Most of these folks advocate strongly for economic, social, sexual, political, religious, etc., etc., freedoms. All the freedoms, if you will. I’m honored to be a part of it all, and to be surrounded by such brilliant—but also compassionate—people. My friends and colleagues in so many libertarian organizations are amazing human beings, and they are models of what libertarianism really means.

But—and you knew there would be a “but”—it’s time for me to [check my privilege](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/check-your-privilege). The incredible people I work with and spend time with are the exceptional libertarians, not the norm. When people outside of my wonderful little bubble hear the word “libertarian”, they think of someone completely different from us. They don’t think about nice, normal people who try to stop civil rights abuses and prevent heavy-handed government meddling in private affairs. They don’t even think of the gruff but lovable [Ron Swanson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson), whose only real ambition is to eat meat, carve wood, and gum up the works of local government.

No, the definition of libertarianism is, to so many Americans, something wholly offensive and terrible. It’s an ideology that doesn’t care about racism or sexism or immigrants or the poor. It’s an idea that works only for rich white men. Libertarians are people who defend the Confederacy and call Lincoln a tyrant. They are Social Darwinists, championing the rich and powerful. They believe that everything good in this world should be sold to the highest bidder, and who cares if some people starve as a result—their poverty is proof of their weakness.

That view of libertarianism couldn’t be further from the truth, at least for myself and the people I know. But it’s what many people believe. And they believe it, in part, because it’s true outside my bubble. There are a great many people, calling themselves libertarian, who act like that.

This morning I read [confessional of an ex-“libertarian”](http://groupthink.jezebel.com/i-am-a-lady-and-i-am-a-libertarian-do-most-people-rea-563548637) who seemed, at his most libertarian, to exemplify a lot of those horrible libertarian stereotypes. This part hit me most, because it just seemed so entirely out-of-sync with my views and the views of the libertarians I know.

> As recently as the beginning of last year, I was still calling myself a libertarian, even though I’d given up the ghost on that one long before. I noticed that more and more libertarian ideas just didn’t ring true, and I really noticed that libertarians are made up of almost entirely white males, and that struck me. I tried to figure out what was nagging at the back of my mind, what was telling me that I may not be in the right place.
>
> Then I went on that terrible date. And the voice was clear. YOU CAN’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. Privilege in a nutshell. Once I saw that, it was game over. It’s a simple idea, really: If I am to accept libertarian ideology as legitimate, then logic dictates that I believe that women, people of color, etc., make less money than white men for the same jobs because there is something inherently lesser about them. This is, quite obviously, bullshit, and abhorrently so. As I’m not a monstrous human, even my feeble libertarian ego saw that it was bullshit and that was the end of libertarianism for all intents and purposes.

I don’t know any libertarians who believe that some people are inherently inferior to others. Not one. If I ever did know them, I long ago cut them out of my life, because who wants to hang out with bigots?

And that voice—the one telling him that he couldn’t possibly know what he was talking about, and the beginning of his rejection of libertarianism—that voice *is the very basis* of my libertarianism! The more I learn, the more I realize how little I know. I embrace a free society based on the fact that *none of us* knows very much. Even the best intentions by bureaucratic planners will likely fail in the face of an overwhelming knowledge deficit. The more control each of us has over our own lives, the better our odds for figuring out our own lives and not [falling victim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) to the [horrifying implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust) of [someone else’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward) “[truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution)”.

This past weekend, I got the chance to see an old college friend and a former member of the UNC College Libertarians from my time with the group. He told me that he wasn’t really so libertarian anymore. I was curious, of course, so I asked him more about it. While there may be other issues he didn’t discus, one thing he did mention was that he started to believe a social safety net was a good idea.

That’s it? Is that all it takes to make someone not libertarian? Better throw out all of [Friedrich Hayek’s work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek#The_economic_calculation_problem), then! Believing it’s important to help those who, through no fault of their own, fall on tough times, is no moral failing. It certainly shouldn’t be some cardinal sin that makes it impossible to be libertarian. While I’m always skeptical of government’s attempts to implement a safety net, I’m not opposed to safety nets in general. There are plenty of ways it could be, or has been done, privately.

It was a bit mind-boggling that a concern for the unlucky should be incompatible with libertarianism. But I think that’s how too many libertarians act, and they emphasize that point so strongly that it drives away many people who really would be sympathetic with the cause of liberty.

The old rich white male racist homophobic pro-Confederacy anti-poor people brand of libertarianism must die. It’s a stain on the ideas of liberty that ought to appeal to all people, the least-well-off especially.

So, how do we kill it?

In the past, libertarians have loved their litmus tests and excommunications. But that hasn’t done a thing to steer libertarianism toward an embrace of total freedom for all people. If anything, it seems to have made things worse.

I think the best way to kill off the privileged and bigoted brand of libertarianism is instead openness. It requires making ourselves open to people of all backgrounds, and truly listening to their ideas.

<del>I think [Students For Liberty](http://studentsforliberty.org/) may do this best. When I think of the truly compassionate libertarians who welcome all to liberty with open arms, I’m often thinking of the incredible leaders I’ve known by working with SFL through the years. I’m proud to work with SFL and support their mission. They give me hope for a better libertarianism.</del> <ins>**Update July 12, 2015**: It's been a while since I've had contact with anyone at SFL, whether students or staff. Most of the people I knew there have moved on to other jobs. I think I'm just getting old and don't care to spend as much time with young people anymore. So I can't say anymore how well SFL embraces openness. Also, get off my lawn!</ins>

But it’s not just up to SFL. Every libertarian who really and truly believes that liberty is good for all of us, and can do the most to help those with the least, must make that case clearly and directly. We shouldn’t wall ourselves off from the world behind mountains of economics texts while the Ron Paul [hangers-on](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/04/ron-paul-home-schooling-curriculum/64047/) peddle their [disgusting pseudo-libertarianism](http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/23/academic-board-of-new-ron-paul-institute-includes-911-truther-other-radicals/). The libertarians who want to see a better world, not just for ourselves, but for every race and ethnicity, every gender identity, every person despite their wealth or background or religious belief (or lack thereof) must make that world a reality ourselves. We need to be the ones to publicly embrace all people, and to stand up for their liberties.

If we fail to do that, then we’ve earned all the derision that the label “libertarian” so often entails.
