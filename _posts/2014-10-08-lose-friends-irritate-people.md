description: "A few minutes of my time each day to share what I’m working on and to learn what others are doing is a very small price to pay. Having seen the alternative, I’m happy to endure sometimes boring status meetings to make sure everyone is in-the-loop rather than the dark."

As I’m writing this, just outside my office the streets are jammed with countless taxi cabs all honking incessantly. Presumably, these taxis are protesting the very existence of [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), a service which I’ve used before and found both cheaper and more convenient than regular taxis. I can hear the horns blaring from inside, and I’m not even in an exterior office with a window. They’ve been going at it for nearly an hour now with no end in sight.

I can only conclude that these cab driver are insane. When they pull stunts like this, they only alienate the public. No one enduring this nonsense today is going to walk away thinking: “Hey, Uber makes life hard for regular cabbies, maybe we should help the taxis out.” Instead, most of us will end up cheering the taxis’ demise.

This lashing out by taxi drivers is reminiscent of Luddites who smashed factory machinery. The factories didn’t go away, and we now refer to anyone who is stubbornly backward and opposed to technological progress as a luddite. Such purely destructive acts do not endear you to the public. This form of protest only signals your outright refusal to embrace change or adapt to new circumstances. When people who do this inevitably fail, we look at them with little sympathy.
