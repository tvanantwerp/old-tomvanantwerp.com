Don’t have much time to build anything today. It’s been a long, stressful work day. I’ve decided that whatever game I build for Ludum Dare, it’s likely to be 2D. I know less about 3D modeling than game development, and doubt I could learn either very well in only two weeks. I’ve got a decade of Photoshop/Illustrator experience, however, so hopefully I can bang out some sprites without much difficulty. I’ll be spending time this evening watching [this video](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d/2d-controllers) on 2D character controllers, after having watched all the other 2D videos in that tutorial series.

The coming weekend is [Warmup Weekend](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/11/warmup-weekend-for-ludum-dare-30/). It will probably be more intense than a mere warm-up for me, but that’s fine. If I can build some semblance of a game this Saturday and Sunday, then I know I’ll be on the right track for Ludum Dare itself.

If anyone reading my blog has suggestions or comments, feel free to email me or say something on Twitter. Everyone has been very supportive so far, and I’ve gotten lots of good advice. Thanks to everyone who is encouraging me in this insane endeavor!
