This morning I read an article on the increasing numbers of “[permanent interns](http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/the-age-of-the-permanent-intern/index.php)”, particularly in my current city of Washington, DC. The article’s tagline suggests a sort of [Great Stagnation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation) among my generation:

> Many of the ambitious young people who flock to Washington toil for years as low-paid interns—and count themselves lucky to do so. Is this what success looks like in 2013?

It goes on to describe all the job seekers going after the very few openings, preferring to toil as unpaid interns than accept a full-time job without meaning or career potential. This does happen. I see it happen often. The article, naturally, frames this as a tragedy for the innumerable underemployed twenty-somethings. And, yeah, it does suck for them. I’m not in quite such a bad place, but I can understand that pain. I was an intern like that once.

But the overabundance of sympathy for my starving would-be-wonk comrades obscures an important truth. The article chronicles the story of Jessica, perpetual political intern struggling to get by. But it also makes a short note of her brother’s fate:

> Jessica’s brother, who is 28 and a mechanical aerospace engineer at SpaceX, a company that designs and manufactures spacecraft and rockets, used to tell his younger sister he couldn’t understand why she’d work for next to nothing. He has been gainfully employed and making more than he needs since the day he graduated from college, Jessica says.

If you learn to do things that are difficult and valuable, you will probably be successful. If you just want to write blogs all day about your personal vision for the future of society, you’ll probably stay poor. This is the market at work.

My generation has slowly been learning the hard way that all our parents, teachers and mentors who told us to follow our dreams were full of crap. When our childhood brains tried to understand this, we found an excuse to be selfish and lazy. We didn’t put in the effort to learn the really hard things, and instead followed our dreams to the exclusion of the real needs of the marketplace. Success became less of a thing you worked toward, and more of a thing you expected to receive at the appointed time. Some people really did put in the hard work to make their dreams happen, but so many more chose live in the dream world and remain asleep.

I’m guilty of falling into this trap. In retrospect, I wish I had completed a [STEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) degree in college. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed what I did and (usually) enjoy what I’m doing now. But I could have done a whole lot more and been much better off if I’d taken the technical route. Now that I’m employed and married, it’s hard to find time or money to go back and learn those things I wish I’d studied. Not impossible, and I am trying, but it’s so much harder.

But at least I feel better knowing that the demand for spaceship designers is high and the demand for government nerds is low. There may be hope for this world yet.
