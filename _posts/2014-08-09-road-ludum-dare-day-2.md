I’ve spent yesterday and today practicing beginner tutorials and challenges from [Unity3DStudent](http://www.unity3dstudent.com/category/modules/beginner/). I’m starting to get comfortable in Unity3D, and I’m slowly familiarizing myself with its structure. Still lots I don’t understand, and my scripting knowledge has lots of room to grow. Although Unity3D allows for the use of “JavaScript”, I’m thinking I should learn C# if I’m going to pick this up in the long run. There are too many peculiarities to the way Unity3D implements JavaScript, such that I’m hesitant to learn them and accidentally start implementing them in webdev projects. I may use their JavaScript for now just for ease, but I won’t stick to it.

My first goal today was to complete [this challenge](http://www.unity3dstudent.com/2010/07/challenge-c01-beginner/), which I’ve done. I also went a little above and beyond, including some things I learned in the other video lessons. I’ve never been good at following instructions exactly as presented, and I think that’s always helped me learn how systems works rather than how to work a system.
