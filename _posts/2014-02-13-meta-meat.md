description: "If your brain is just meat, then going one level of abstraction up is what I’m calling meta-meat. You could also call it a soul, though I think that’s a loaded term. A soul is unique and mystical; meta-meat is just the pattern of an information processing system, something quantifiable and reproducible. Wooden boards are wooden boards; but the Ship of Theseus is a pattern, an idea. Casablanca is still Casablanca whether on film or VHS or DVD or Blu-ray. A person would be the same person regardless of physical format."

I recently saw a trailer for the upcoming movie [*Transcendence*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764). It looks good, and I’m excited to see it. From the trailer, the film ought to touch on several issues relating to the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity): the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) question, [gray goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo), existential risks to the human species, and whether or not [TED](http://www.ted.com/) speakers will be the death of us all.

Of the themes from the *Transcendence* trailer, the one that seemed strongest was this: is a human mind, uploaded into a computer, still the same person?

> **Update**: I heard the movie itself turned out to be quite bad, so I never watched it. The rest of the post, I think, is solid regardless of whether or not this was a good film.

How the film will answer this question remains to be seen. It’s a complicated question worth contemplation. A similar question was noted by the ancient historian Plutarch:

> “The ship wherein [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus) and the youth of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) returned from [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete) had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of [Demetrius Phalereus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_Phalereus), for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, in so much that this ship became a standing example among the [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher), for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.”

The Ship of Theseus paradox is this: if you replaced each wooden board in Theseus’s ship, one at a time, would it still be Theseus’s ship when you’re done? Same shape, same functionality, same paint job—but every single atom of the boat has been swapped out. Though the question is quite old, but it’s highly relevant here. If you could move the essence of a mind—personality, memories, dreams and emotions—from a body of flesh into a machine, is it still the original person?

The answer depends on what you believe makes a person. If you think of a man as meat, then the copy is not the person. The end. However, most of us don’t really think that—at least, not in practice. If Joe Schmoe is injured and loses a limb, we don’t think of him as 20% less of Joe Schmoe. Midgets aren’t less of a person than average humans, nor are NBA players more human than average. The mass of your [meat](http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html) is meaningless.

What’s more important is the pattern of a person. The specific molecules in a neuron matter less than how that neuron communicates with other neurons. A brain is meat. A person is a configuration of meat which produces behavioral outputs given sensory inputs. If a machine can be configured to produce identical outputs given the same inputs, is it really not the same person?

Again, I’m not sure how *Transcendence* will treat this idea, but I love how the show [*Caprica*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799862/) presented it. In that show, Zoe Graystone creates an AI version of herself using algorithms and metadata. Compiling and processing her own digital footprints gives the AI the ability to act as Zoe would act, and even “remember” events from her life. The AI is, effectively, a copy of the flesh-and-blood Zoe. Zoe’s father, Daniel, is forced to eventually conclude of the AI: “A difference that makes no difference is no difference.”

If your brain is just meat, then going one level of abstraction up is what I’m calling *meta-meat*. You could also call it a soul, though I think that’s a loaded term. A soul is unique and mystical; meta-meat is just the pattern of an information processing system, something quantifiable and reproducible. Wooden boards are wooden boards; but the Ship of Theseus is a pattern, an idea. [*Casablanca*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/) is still *Casablanca* whether on film or VHS or DVD or Blu-ray. A person would be the same person regardless of physical format.

I don’t believe in the inevitability or imminence of the singularity. Lot’s of things could derail progress toward advanced AI and uploading human brains into machines. But I’m hopeful that it will happen one day, and I’m looking forward to leaving my meat behind. It’s only a matter of time until this squishy meatbag falls apart, and I, the meta-meat, don’t care to fall apart with it.

As for those who still have a problem with mechanically-assisted immortality, I’ll quote from [*Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom*](http://craphound.com/down/Cory_Doctorow_-_Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom.htm):

> Everyone who had serious philosophical conundra on that subject just, you know, *died*, a generation before. [Society] didn’t need to convert its detractors, just outlive them.
