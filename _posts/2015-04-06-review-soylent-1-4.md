When Soylent launched it’s first crowdfunding campaign, I backed it. A year or so later, no Soylent in hand and impatient with delays, I canceled my funding. Maybe a year ago, after they were finally selling subscriptions, I tried buying it again. I watched my wait time go from 2-3 months to 4-5 months, and canceled again in frustration—and after [trying it without being impressed](/soylent-first-impressions/). But now Soylent has got the funding necessary to really ramp up logistics, and [I’m desperate to find a new and workable diet](/diverticulosis/). So I ordered a month’s worth of Soylent, and received it within the week.

I can best describe the newest Soylent formula as a sand smoothie.

While it’s certainly nice that the bottle of oil is no longer necessary, there are very distinct grains of particulate. [My blender is not exactly a lightweight](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VWXXXK/), but there’s not much I can do about the grainy texture. I can feel bits of it get stuck in the back of my throat, and I’m concerned that—instead of helping my live with diverticular disease—the grains could cause diverticulitis.

The flavor is also pretty bland. I’m experimenting with flavoring it myself, but haven’t had too much luck. Cocoa powder helps a bit. Using coconut water made no difference. When I find something that works, I’ll share it.

While I’m very please with Soylent’s ability to actually ship product for a change, Soylent version 1.4 still isn’t quite right.

It’s still too early in my Soylent diet to see how it affects my health and energy levels, but I’ll be tracking my consumption and trying to quantify any changes.
