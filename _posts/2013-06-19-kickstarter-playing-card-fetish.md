As many of my friends know, I love beautiful graphic design. When not [practicing it myself](http://dribbble.com/tvanantwerp), I like to see what others are doing. I’m also a huge fan of crowdfunding projects. I’ve helped [build a Telsa museum](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/let-s-build-a-goddamn-tesla-museum--5), [created glow-in-the-dark plants](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antonyevans/glowing-plants-natural-lighting-with-no-electricit), monitored my [brain waves](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806146824/melon-a-headband-and-mobile-app-to-measure-your-fo), built a [medical tricorder](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scanadu-scout-the-first-medical-tricorder), and [made food obsolete](https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body). So when something combines the two, I get really excited!

For the past couple of months, I’ve noticed a trend on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) of very successful graphic design projects. Lots of folks are creating very lovely decks of playing cards. Many too many folks, in fact. But whether or not it’s an over-done fad, some of these decks are gorgeous. My favorites are below.

## [A Deck of Playing Cards by Pedale Design](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1537415287/a-deck-of-playing-cards-by-pedale-design)

This was definitely the first crowdfunded playing card set I saw, and maybe the first such project attempted at Kickstarter. The illustration looks elegant without being overly fancy, thin without lacking in substance. It’s a very creative re-imagining of how decks of cards can look.

## [Federal 52](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1722808047/federal-52-a-new-bicycle-playing-card-deck)

This is probably my second favorite Kickstarter deck. I’ve always loved the design of old money, as has artist Jackson Robinson. And while the US Treasury keeps making our currency uglier and uglier, these cards at least are a vast improvement over traditional decks. The detail of the line work is amazing. You can really see the monetary inspiration. Even if you lose your shirt in a game of poker, just holding these cards could make you feel a little richer. As of writing this, [he’s also crowdfunding a second set of Federal 52 decks](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1722808047/federal-52-part-2-a-new-bicycle-playing-card-deck).

## [Founders Playing Cards](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dodsr/founders-playing-card)

Not unlike the Federal 52, this deck takes a cue from American history and government. However, the Founders deck is inspired more by the history of America itself than it’s money alone. While I may not like everyone featured on the face cards (lookin’ at you, FDR), I love that Uncle Sam plays the Joker and that the rules have been replaced with the Bill of Rights. Oh, and did I mention the design is lovely?

## [Calaveras](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1894542039/calaveras-day-of-the-dead-inspired-bicycle-playing)

As I write, this one is still accepting backers. Chris Ovdiyenko has created a fantastic Day of the Dead style that incorporates skeletal imagery and Mexican culture into an amazing deck.

## [Mustache Playing Cards](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goldklangdesign/mustache-playing-cards-a-uspc-card-deck-from-vanda?ref=category)

Ok, this one is a bit silly. But it’s probably a good choice for the card-playing hipster in your life. I love the vibrant colors and the mix between serious mustaches and playful artwork. I can’t say I would have ever thought to design a deck of cards based around a love of the mustache, but it surprisingly works.
