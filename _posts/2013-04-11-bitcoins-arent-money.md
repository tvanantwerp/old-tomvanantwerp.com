Bitcoins bubbled, and yesterday [they deflated](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/04/bitcoin-crashes-losing-nearly-half-of-its-value-in-six-hours/). It’s been exciting to watch this past week, as more and more attention was given to bitcoins in the wake of the Cyprus bailout. Whether it will rise again, or plummet back to worthlessness, I don’t know. What I do know is that bitcoins won’t replace dollars, for the simple reason that they aren’t money.

To understand why bitcoins fall short, let’s consider what money is. [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money):

> The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment.

Bitcoins fail to reasonably satisfy any of these requirements.

## Medium of Exchange

I’ve never bought anything with bitcoins. No store in my city, to my knowledge, accepts bitcoins. I wouldn’t really know how to pay them with bitcoins even if they did. Some fringe Internet shops (including the infamous [Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace))) accept bitcoin as payment, but I’ve never visited them and don’t plan on it. Not when I can buy whatever I want from Amazon in a few short clicks with the US dollars I’ve already got.

There’s a network effect to currencies. The more people accept a given currency, the more useful that currency is. That’s why even fiat currencies like the US dollar and the Euro are still much stronger monies than bitcoin. I know exactly how to get those currencies, and who will accept them and how. Bitcoin? Not so much.

I started trying to buy bitcoins about a week ago, just to see how it worked. As of today, I still haven’t figured it out. I installed a “wallet” on my laptop, and it still isn’t sync’ed up with the 6 gigabyte blockchain that verifies all bitcoin transactions ever. I got a MtGox account, but I couldn’t figure out how to give them my US dollars to get bitcoins. I set up a Dwolla account to transfer money to MtGox (which took 3 days to get verified), and then discovered that I couldn’t until I also got my MtGox account verified. That entailed scanning my driver’s license and proof of residency. It’s at this point that I simply gave up.

Bitcoins are very illiquid. Aside from hard transaction limits on sites like MtGox, I just can’t exchange bitcoins for other items of value quickly and easily. This is their first major limitation that makes them a non-currency.

## Unit of Account

Cash is a pretty decent accounting unit. You tally up dollars going out and dollars coming in, and you’ll know whether you’ve come out ahead. Not so with bitcoin. Aside from the previous limitation—the fact that nobody does business in bitcoins, so you can’t really use them for accounting purposes—bitcoins yesterday and bitcoins today are just too different to tell you a meaningful story about profit and loss. Sure, fiat currencies’ inflation requires adjustments to historical accounting records to truly understand long-term trends. But not nearly on the scale of bitcoin. This is due to failure number three…

## Store of Value

A dollar today should be worth approximately a dollar tomorrow. This isn’t exactly true, but it’s true enough to allow the economy to function with fiat currency. But the value of a bitcoin today tells you nothing about the value of a bitcoin tomorrow. The volatility in the price of bitcoins relative to established currencies is insanely high. While I can be reasonably sure that cash I save will keep most of its value by next year, a single bitcoin might have tripled in value or lost just as much. It’s unpredictable. [At best, it’s a speculative investment](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#tgMzm1g10zm2g25zv). But it is not a store of value like a quality currency.

Even gold, with it’s price fluctuations over the past few years, is a better store of value. I can think of several practical uses for gold. I can think of none for a string of seemingly random letters and numbers.

## Standard of Deferred Payment

In the same way I can’t buy lunch at the local sub shop in bitcoins, I can’t pay rent or utility bills in bitcoins either. Nobody accepts them. Add in bitcoins’ high volatility, and there’s an extra layer of risk to denominating debts in them. A lender might make a killing off of a bitcoin payment, or he might suffer huge losses. Again, it’s unpredictable. When the company I rent my apartment from tells me what to pay, and waits a few days to get the check and process it, they don’t have to worry that my rent payment will become worthless before the transaction is completed.

## Conclusion

Despite all my criticisms, I think bitcoins are cool. Governments have frequently manipulated fiat currency, often to the detriment of those who most require a safe store of value. I’m excited by the prospect of people finding new ways to transact that aren’t so susceptible to government manipulation. But bitcoin falls very short of replacing government-issued fiat currency.

Maybe when Elon Musk is done putting NASA out of business, he can go head-to-head with the Treasury.
