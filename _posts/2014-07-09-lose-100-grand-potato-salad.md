[This](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad) is the most hilarious Kickstarter I’ve ever seen. [One of the best](http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/7/5876971/kickstarter-potato-salad-crowdfunding). I pledged $5 myself, hopeful that I’ll get a taste of that tangy potato salad. However, I’m not holding out much hope. Zack Danger Brown will probably go bankrupt, spending over $100,000 trying to fulfill his potato salad pledges.

(The good news: the [tax burden](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/21000-tax-bill-just-some-potato-salad) my colleagues at Tax Foundation estimated for him will drop to zero.)

Here are my estimates as of 4:09pm EST, 7/9/2014:

| Reward | Backers Claiming Reward | Unit Cost | Total Cost |
|:--- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| Say Donor’s Name | 4,899 | 0 | 0 |
| Postcard Thank You | 3,357 | $0.38 | $1,278.86 |
| One Bite of Potato Salad | 2,437 | $28.62 | $69,745.65 |
| Choose an Ingredient | 1,573 | $0.39 | $938.63 |
| Visit Kitchen | 1,119 | 22.34 | $25,000.00 |
| Haiku | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Hat | 242 | 8.50 | $2,057.00 |
| T-Shirt | 473 | 5.25 | $2,483.25 |
| Potato Salads of the World Cook Book | 87 | 3.25 | $282.75 |
| Total | 4,899 | n/a | $101,786.14 |

## Methodology

I made a number of assumptions to reach these estimates. Each reward has unique inputs to account for, and I probably missed a few or estimated wrongly. But I’ll list everything out below, as well as my justification.

### Say My Name and Write a Haiku

First, I assumed that Zack Danger Brown (hereafter ZDB) is a bum of some sort with no valuable skills. His opportunity costs would therefore be zero, allowing me to negate the value of his time. It would take him nearly 3 hours to say the name of every donor while making the potato salad (4,899 names at 2 seconds per name), but my assumption lets me ignore little things like this. I also set the cost of the haikus at zero, since his bum poetry will be without value and the potatoes he’ll carve it into would have gone into the potato salad anyway.

### Postcards

This was an easy one: I looked up the cost of [bulk printing 5,000 postcards at Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/postcards.aspx?psite=mkwid%7cPZLqLS0h&crtv=46266095779&mk=vistaprint&ad=e&device=c&couponAutoload=1&GP=7%2f9%2f2014+2%3a57%3a51+PM&GPS=3229234563&GNF=0) and added [postage](http://postcalc.usps.gov/postcards.aspx) to each one he must send.

### A Bite of Potato Salad

Unfortunately for ZDB, shipping thousands of bites of potato salad is expensive! Since this is a perishable food product, ZDB needs a [cooling pack](http://www.uline.com/BL_2167/Single-Use-Cold-Packs?keywords=cold%20packs) and [insulated shipping envelope](http://www.uline.com/BL_2170/Insulated-Mailers). Those aren’t cheap, but at least he’s buying in bulk. Selecting what I guess are appropriate Uline products gives packaging costs of $1.17. I averaged the 1-day shipping cost of a 5 oz package (bite + packaging) via USPS from Columbus to my home in Arlington, VA (east coast) and to Beverly Hills, CA (west coast). Let’s pretend there are no international backers. The shipping is the real killer, and adds $28.62 to the final cost-per-bite.

### Choose an Ingredient

I wanted to get a sense of how much a bite of potato salad might cost. Since this is likely a fancy potato salad, I compared it to the cost of one purchased from Whole Foods in Columbus, Ohio where ZDB lives. [2 pounds of Whole Foods Potato Salad comes to $8.99 per pound](http://shop.wholefoodsmarket.com/store/Sides-Grilling/Picnic-Potato-Salad-P14498C2292.aspx). If we think of 1/2 oz. as a single bite, then this comes to about $0.14.

However, with backer ingredient requests, this cost could be much different. Some people would have simple requests, others luxurious ones. At first I wondered [what would happen if someone requested the most expensive food in the world](http://www.therichest.com/luxury/most-expensive/the-top-10-most-expensive-food-in-the-world/), but I don’t see white truffle being accepted as “potato-salad-appropriate”. So I looked for an appropriate, but pricey, ingredient. I settled on the [La Bonnotte potato](http://most-expensive.com/potato) from France, which averaged $45/lbs.

So I calculated unit costs thus: 95% of people would request simple but delicious Duke’s Mayonnaise, 5% would request the most expensive potato in the world. Given this split, the estimated cost-per-bite is $0.39

Knowing the Internet, this is probably a conservative estimate of how cruel a backer is likely to be in his or her ingredient selection. For the sake of the estimation, please suspend your disbelief.

### Join ZDB in the Kitchen

About a thousand backers are invited to join ZDB in the kitchen while he makes the potato salad. My efforts to look up the largest kitchen in Columbus were unsuccessful, so I settled on choosing a large open space instead. I figured, ZDB can set up kitchen equipment in the center of [Ohio Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Stadium). It costs [$25,000/day to rent](http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/osu/graphics/pdf/facilities/facility-rental-guidelines.pdf), which split among the backers who’ve earned that reward comes to $22.34/person.

### Hat, Shirt, and Potato Salad Recipe Book

For the [hat](http://www.vistaprint.com/custom-hats.aspx) and [shirt](http://www.vistaprint.com/custom-tshirts.aspx), I used Vistaprint again to estimate costs. For the book, I used [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/publish/books/?cid=nav_bks). The estimates came to $8.50, $5.25, and $3.25 respectively.
