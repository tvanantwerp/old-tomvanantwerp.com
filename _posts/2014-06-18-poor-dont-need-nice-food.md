[Good and Cheap](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/490865454/good-and-cheap?ref=nav_search) by Leanne Brown is a cookbook designed for people like me: a penny-pincher with fancy tastes. For less than $4, I can make roasted cauliflower tacos or a peach coffee cake. Some of these recipes sound fantastic, and I can’t wait to try them out.

The people who won’t try them, however, are the people the book is meant to help: the poor.

Leanne’s goal with Good and Cheap is this: provide access to high quality food for low-income households by helping them build their cooking skills. While I’m all for improving the conditions of the impoverished, this solution is asinine. Why? [Opportunity cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).

Of all the things a poor person could be doing with their time to improve their life, cooking is probably the least of them. Most likely, they will spend their time trying to make ends-meet. When every hour you work contributes substantially to your ability to pay the bills, that’s where your focus will be. A leisurely trip to the nearest organic co-op, followed by an hour or two of cooking, sounds pleasant. But working that second job so you can make the rent takes priority.

When the opportunity cost of cooking yourself is forgoing an hour of Netflix (the likely cost for a white Millennial), then it’s not a big deal. When the opportunity cost is your ability to afford the essentials of life, it makes sense to pick up some junk food on the way home.

Even if a poor person manages to free up some time in the evenings, is cooking really the best skill to learn? Again, what’s the opportunity cost? I have to believe that the poor would prefer to be not poor, and that such a preference is greater than a desire for regular tasty home-cooked meals. Going to school or learning a trade would have a much greater lifelong payoff than cooking.

In the introduction to Good and Cheap, Leanne writes:

> If you want a better life, filled with daily pleasures; learn to cook. If you want to get control over a small food budget; learn to cook. If you want a healthy body and mind for yourself and your family; learn to cook.

This is all true. This is also a list of things which are not top priorities for the truly impoverished. The top priorities are to survive, and to escape poverty. At this subsistence level, food is merely fuel.

The poor don’t need nice food. They need cheap, quick, nutritious food that isn’t a chore to acquire or prepare.

Frankly, they should just buy [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/).

> **Update**: It appears I’ve been reading an older version of the book’s introduction. Much of the vacuous language has been removed in the most recent version, available from the [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/490865454/good-and-cheap). No doubt many of the readers from Reddit and elsewhere pointed out what I have, and Leanne edited the book accordingly.
