Feeling a bit dead tonight. I haven’t accomplished much of anything tonight–I feel like I’m getting past the quick and easy stuff, and that showing off daily progress from here on is going to get tricky. Still feeling confident I can put something together during Ludum Dare now, but it surely won’t be very polished. As I mentioned yesterday, creating art will become a real bottleneck. Even with a decade of Photoshop and Illustrator under my belt, that stuff still takes time. But I need to think of this not as an all-or-nothing proposition, but as the beginning of my journey to becoming a competent game developer. I’ll have 48 hours to make my game for Ludum Dare, and the rest of my life to keep learning.
