I've [had a lot](http://tomvanantwerp.com/soylent-first-impressions/) to [say](http://tomvanantwerp.com/review-soylent-1-4/) about [Soylent](http://tomvanantwerp.com/worst-part-of-soylent-is-people/) before, and most of it negative. The latest formulation, Soylent 2.0, changes all of that.

First, here's what's wrong with old versions of Soylent:

- Powder was messy and clumped up.
- Had to let it sit in the fridge overnight, or else it was grainy.
- Pitcher was a pain to clean. Lots of little crevices for Soylent to get stuck in.
- The flavor was overwhelmingly bland. (Not hyperbole--nothing I mixed with it ever made it taste not-bland.)
- Had the consistency of snot.
- Often disposed of old Soylent due to short post-mixing shelf life. Inconvenient and hard to plan meals around it.
- When people see you mixing Soylent and you tell them you're replacing food with the stuff, they judge you.

That's a *lot* of problems. It's why I've got an unused six-week supply of Soylent 1.4 sitting around in my office.

Thankfully, **Soylent 2.0 solves every one of those previous pain points**. It's finally the product I've been wanting.

Soylent 2.0, unlike previous versions, comes pre-mixed in single-serving plastic bottles. It's much more beverage-like. I could almost mistake it for unsweetened and unflavored almond milk. The flavor is milder, it's smoother, and there's no feeling of graininess. And since it's pasteurized, the bottles can sit in the refrigerator for a year rather than a mere 48 hours. I don't have to worry about throwing out a liter of Soylent because of an unexpected lunch outing with coworkers. And no one is going to think twice about a man who grabs a bottle of something from the fridge and just drinks it. It's pleasantly inconspicuous. And when I'm done, I can toss the bottle in the recycling. No more mess.

It's taken time, but Soylent has finally matured as a product.
