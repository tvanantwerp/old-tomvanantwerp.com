Information about the National Security Agency’s massive electronic surveillance programs against all Americans [was recently leaked](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) to the press by insider [Edward Snowden](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video). For those who pay attention to government wrongdoings, [NSA spying isn’t exactly news](https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel). But Snowden’s leaks provide much more concrete evidence than what was previously available.

Snowden is also, apparently, a [donor to the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign](http://dailycaller.com/2013/06/09/nsa-whistleblower-donated-to-ron-pauls-presidential-campaign/). And he is said to have voted for a third party candidate in 2008.

There’s a real possibility that Edward Snowden is a libertarian. And this may be very bad news for libertarians.

Let’s assume that most of the NSA’s focus has been on targets like al-Qaeda. Terrorists are typically considered the most prominent threat to US security, and can be expected to receive the full attention of intelligence agencies. Despite the fact the the NSA was collecting information on all Americans, it wasn’t actively using it. That doesn’t mean they were in the right to collect it, but at least they probably weren’t abusing it as badly as they could.

But now a rogue individual within the intelligence community has exposed one of the NSA’s largest secrets. The organization commonly called “no such agency” is in the spotlight, which is the last place they ever wanted to be. It’s unlikely that any one terrorist plot could damage the NSA itself more than Edward Snowden just did, and they won’t soon forget it.

If, as some of the evidence suggests, Snowden leans libertarian, then libertarians in the US and possibly across the world should be very concerned. Before these leaks, we were not worth the notice of organizations like the NSA. To paraphrase the title of a [Banksy book](http://www.amazon.com/Banksy-You-Acceptable-Level-Threat/dp/1908211083): libertarians are an acceptable level of threat, and if we were not we would know about it.

But now, our political philosophy may be seen as directly influencing “treasonous” acts. Libertarians can expect to come under greater personal scrutiny from government. All those communications of ours that the NSA intercepted but ignored may now be brought under a microscope. We may face greater levels of harassment by government officials and agencies at all levels, much in the way that many Muslim communities already endure. Life for libertarians may become much more unpleasant as a result of Edward Snowden’s actions.

None of this means I wish he hadn’t leaked those documents. I think Snowden was correct to want to expose such government abuse. Most of my friends have called him a hero since his identity became public, and I think they’re right.

But exposing  NSA surveillance to the light of day will not immediately stop it. It’s reasonable to expect retaliation, both against Snowden personally and against anyone who might share his political views. The NSA will do what it thinks it must to protect itself and its ongoing operations, just as all large bureaucracies do. And if it decides libertarians are a threat, then libertarians should watch out.
