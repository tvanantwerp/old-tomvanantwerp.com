On August 23-24, I will be participating in [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/), a 48-hour video game making event. My goal: make a video game of my own from scratch. As of right now, I have just over 14 days to train. I have never made a video game before, and I have how to begin—I am completely unprepared. This is exciting and terrifying!

Making video games was a childhood dream of mine. I first started playing around with graphic design because I loved gaming and wanted to experiment with textures. I never really followed through with that dream until now. My birthday is just days after Ludum Dare, and I want to push myself to fulfill that dream before then.

So how will I do it?

First, I need clearly defined goals for this process. Games come in many sizes, styles, genres, etc. If I’m not clear about constitutes success, then I’m likely to waste all my time designing lovely textures that never get used. So here are my bare minimum requirements for making a game:

* The game runs, i.e., it can be opened and things happen.
* The game accepts player input.
* Player input logically results in visual/auditory changes inside the game environment.
* Player input and game responses form a feedback loop, i.e., an interactive experience.
* The game somehow incorporates the (as-of-yet unannounced) Ludum Dare theme.

These are very, very minimal requirements. Nothing about graphics, genres, or even whether or not it’s fun. I fully expect my first video game to suck a lot. But it will play! Focusing on getting the game to run, accept input, and respond sensibly to input will be the 20% of my effort that gets me 80% of the way to a good game.

Second, I need to actually build this thing. Because I have little time or experience, I’m choosing to use the [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/) platform. It’s got a large community of support, many tutorials, and, from the look of it, should handle lots of the complicated details for me. I’ve contemplated using JavaScript frameworks to make a web-based game, but I know web dev well enough to know that I’ll spend lots of time fixing bugs in my code rather than building my game. Unity 3D should be as close to a drag-and-drop game making experience as I’m going to get, and will make rapid prototyping easier. I’ll also create my own artwork in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. For sound effects, if I get to that, I’ll use [sfxr](https://code.google.com/p/sfxr/)—itself a product of Ludum Dare, I think.

I have no idea how this will turn out. I’m not expecting to hack together the Game of the Year, but I’m determined to pull this off. I’ll keep blogging about my training progress, and maybe during the event itself. Wish me luck, Internet!
