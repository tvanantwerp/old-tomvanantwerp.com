I’ve been invited to speak at American University next week, September 19th, about NSA spying and what individuals can realistically do to protect themselves from the overreaching surveillance state.

Anyone in the DC area is welcome to attend. I’m honored to have been asked to speak by the AU Students For Liberty, and I’ll do my best to give a proper rundown of what we think we know about NSA operations and how best to defend against various levels of threats. I’ve written before about the [dangers of the technologies employed by the NSA](/the-end-of-all-secrets/), [especially for libertarians](/will-libertarians-be-the-nsas-next-targets/). I’ll be going more in-depth on these points, as well as things you can do as individuals and groups to protect yourselves.

I truly believe that the growth of the surveillance state may be the largest threat to individual liberty that mankind has ever faced. Every single person who yearns to be free must recognize their responsibility to resist it, before it’s too late.

I’ll close with a quote from Julian Assange, which may as well be the rallying cry of all libertarians:

> Our task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its self-destruction.
