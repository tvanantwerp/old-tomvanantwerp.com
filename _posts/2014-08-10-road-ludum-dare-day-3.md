This morning I convinced (maybe forced) my wife to watch [Indie Game](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/) with me. Valerie has never really cared about video games, and I’ve never gotten her to play one for more than five minutes. It’s just not her thing. She was very reluctant to watch this film with me at first, but by the end she really enjoyed it. The story of the game developers in Indie Movie is a compelling narrative of the highs and lows of entrepreneurship. Everyone in that film sacrificed a lot to make their games. I’m glad I was able to show Valerie that. I think it helped her respect game developers more, and hopefully let her see the full scope of the challenge I’ve set for myself. These 12 days of Ludum Dare preparation are nothing compared to years of game dev hell, but it’s still going to be tough.

Watching Indie Game also made me think, is this something I would want to do with my life? Would it really be worthwhile to sacrifice as much as the developers in the film? I’m nowhere near as experienced as they were, and I’m hardly a part of the gaming community. I’m skeptical that this will ever be more than a hobby for me. But then again, aren’t all great personal endeavors filled with hardship and sacrifice? I wonder, is there really any escape from how those devs lived if I ever hope to produce any kind of great work?

Of course, today hasn’t been all film and philosophy! While Val took an afternoon nap, I banged out a version of [Unity3DStudent’s second beginner challenge](http://www.unity3dstudent.com/2010/07/challenge-c02-beginner/).

Additionally, thanks to everyone who has offered support and advice over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LD48?src=hash) and at [Ludum Dare’s website](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/). It’s unreal how awesome everyone has been. Looking forward to playing your games!
