On August 11, 2015, I finally left Verizon to join Google's ([Alphabet](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html)'s?) [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/). I've been waiting to make this switch since they first announced Project Fi, and I began the process as soon as I opened their gleaming white package wrapped in a green band. Aside from a few quirks which seem to be resolved, it's been a very smooth experience.

For those unfamiliar with Project Fi, it's Google's new cellular service. It's currently just for users of the Nexus 6, which I thankfully already owned. Data is $10/GB used each month. I've cut my bill in half and will never need to worry about going over again. The app to manage my plan is also very straight-forward and user-friendly. It handled the switching of my number from Verizon to Google with ease--the only hard part was remembering my Verizon account's PIN!

Some weirdness occurred during the first two days. On day one, incoming calls were routing through Google Hangouts on my desktop PC rather than going to my phone. This was a weird issue, and I had to completely disable desktop and mobile Hangouts to get calls to route through. After re-enabling Hangouts, calls seemed fine. They still come up in desktop Hangouts, but at least it also rings through to my phone. I think this is a Google Voice legacy thing that may need to be tweaked for Project Fi. I never found a setting that let me disable incoming calls going through Hangouts--based on conversations with support, I don't think that option exists.

On the second day, my friend [Dan Carvajal](http://dancarvajal.com/) wasn't receiving my text messages. He's on Project Fi too, and I *was* receiving his texts. Still not sure what happened--texts I sent to others got through fine. But he's getting them now, so I'm not worried. Again, I think this could be some weird bug with Google Voice that might be resolved now.

Other than the aforementioned weirdness, I haven't had any issues. I'm excited to have a lower bill with a better service. I consistently had weak signal at work with Verizon--and I work on the penultimate floor of an office two blocks from the White House! There's not much excuse to have bad signal there. That problem is largely gone, and even in weak spots there's always WiFi calling. I'm anticipating a happy relationship with Project Fi!

I'd also like to thank [Scott Greenstone](http://www.scottgreenstone.com/) for all of his help with the few problems I had. If I were having trouble with Verizon, I doubt they would've troubleshot it with me over Twitter.
