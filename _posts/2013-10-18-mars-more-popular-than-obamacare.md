description: "I have my doubts that Obamacare is so bad that people will leave Earth to get away from it, though perhaps some would disagree. But it’s still hilarious that Mars One—which has raised less dollars than it has applicants—has so far better handled Internet traffic than a $100 million government project."

The number of people who have successfully enrolled with Healthcare.gov is being reported at [51,000](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2452537/Administration-sources-Obamacare-website-received-just-51-000-completed-insurance-applications.html). (It’s the Daily Mail, so take that with a grain of salt.) That’s an incredibly low number, but not shocking given the [technological failures](/tech-savvy-absent-obamacare/) of the system.

Meanwhile, the Dutch nonprofit Mars One—which is organizing a one way trip to Mars to establish a permanent human colony—has received [over 200,000 applications](http://www.mars-one.com/en/mars-one-news/press-releases/11-news/500-over-200-000-apply-to-first-ever-recruitment-for-mars-settlement) from people who want to spend the rest of their days on the Red Planet.

I have my doubts that Obamacare is so bad that people will leave Earth to get away from it, though perhaps some would disagree. But it’s still hilarious that Mars One—which has [raised less dollars than it has applicants](http://www.mars-one.com/en/donate)—has so far better handled Internet traffic than a $100 million government project.
