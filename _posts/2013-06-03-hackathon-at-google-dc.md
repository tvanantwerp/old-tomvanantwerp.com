It’s good to step outside the familiar every once in a while. Seeing Google’s offices for the first time was quite an experience! I met many smart, passionate people. I honestly felt a bit stupid, at least in regard to technology. But that’s good—I don’t ever want to become too comfortable with what I think I can do."

This past weekend was the first time I ever participated in a hackathon—the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/)—and I loved it! Admittedly, I’m still a novice coder and was of limited value, but I learned a lot and was at least able to contribute to the graphics of the web app we built. I joined a team from [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/), and helped them with their [ANC Brigade](http://ancbrigade.com/) website. Having lived in DC for a couple of years now, it was great to finally learn more about how the local government here works via this project. I also really enjoyed working on code in a team, and I hope to do something like it again.

Participating in the hackathon was very much outside my everyday experiences. I spend most of my time either with my lovely wife, or with a bunch of misfit libertarians. It’s good to step outside the familiar every once in a while. Seeing Google’s offices for the first time was quite an experience! I met many smart, passionate people. I honestly felt a bit stupid, at least in regard to technology. But that’s good—I don’t ever want to become too comfortable with what I think I can do.

Nearly all of the projects I saw were genuinely amazing and useful, but I was a bit put off by one. Most of these folks lean left, which I expected. There was one participant, [Luke Rosiak](http://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/luke-rosiak/), who was [working to scan all PDF copies of IRS 990s](http://lukerosiak.info/irs/)—the financial documents that nonprofits file with the IRS each year—and asking everyone to support his efforts by donating the $100 Amazon Web Services credit that we all received as participants.  As a nonprofit employee, I can think of many, many good uses for that data. But which example use did he and his supporters cite to convince people to support them? Tracking down people aligned with the Koch brothers.

Now, I’ve got plenty to say about the Kochs too, but is this really the best thing you could think of to do with this data? I have no problem helping make 990 data more accessible. I use it often in my own work, and it could really help people to better understand what is going on at different nonprofits. But I absolutely did not give this guy my AWS credit. I attended the hackathon to learn more about technology and maybe help some ordinary people along the way. I did not attend to help anyone’s political agenda.

Previous project aside, most projects seemed very much in line with my libertarian sympathies—even if their creators weren’t. Governments fail to be transparent or organized or responsive to their constituencies. Smart people who care about solving problems come together to fill in the gaps that government can’t or won’t fill on its own. I’m open about my lack of faith in the government’s ability to solve problems. While others here may not share that belief, they were willing to step up and do what every libertarian should (but usually won’t) do: fix the problems on their own. It was really inspiring, and I hope to be part of more work like this.
