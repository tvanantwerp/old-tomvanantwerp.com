My wife Valerie and I went to see the [Ai Weiwei exhibit at the Hirshhorn](http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/ai-weiwei-according-to-what/#collection=ai-weiwei-according-to-what) last weekend. Having already watched the Ai Weiwei documentary [*Never Sorry*](http://aiweiweineversorry.com/), we recognized most of the pieces in the museum. As is probably true of many Ai Weiwei fans, we like him less for his art than his frequent efforts to piss off the Communist Party. So instead of talking about his art—much of which I don’t really “get” anyway—I’ll talk about the experience of viewing his art. As it turned out, the museum experience felt like like life in a communist state.

The moment Valerie and I entered the museum, a guard yelled at us (not asked, yelled) that she needed to check my wife’s bag. Fine, normal security precautions, I get it. But would a little politeness hurt?

Most of the installation pieces weren’t actually roped off, but were surrounded by four black lines on the floor that acted as a proximity alarm. If someone crossed the line, an irritable noise like a car alarm would fill the room and the nearest guard would yell (again, not ask, yell) to “Step behind the black line!” The guards never left their posts to yell directly at the offending museum goers. That, combined with no prior explanation of the security setup, meant that these alarms were frequent and slow to silence. I’m pretty sure I triggered it once or twice myself.

At one point, I tried to walk around a large installation piece made of rebar. On one side, there was a crowd blocking my way. The other side was clear, but narrower and closer to the wall. It was still enough room for a person or two. So I tried to walk around it on the clear side. But nope, that earned me more yelling. I’m still not sure what was so bad about walking around the other side. Would I offend the rebar? I certainly wasn’t about to damage it from two feet away.

The guards were not acting as conscientious stewards of art; they were bullies, plain and simple. The tone in their voices didn’t convey a serious concern for the safety of the artwork. They were clearly just annoyed. The visitors were people who got in the way of them standing around, doing nothing, and earning a paycheck for it. It’s the same attitude of every bureaucrat I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. When we talked about it afterward, Valerie said she felt the same way.

They reminded me of the kinds of thugs I might find employed by a communist state. I don’t mean soldiers, mind you. They weren’t rounding up visitors and sending them to reeducation camps. They were like low-level cops, paid too little to care about their job and looking to take their frustrations out on any passersby. Watching their behavior made me think of the government goons that Ai Weiwei has dealt with himself in China.

I could be exaggerating. After all, I live in America, not China. Even the crappiest security guard here is probably better than the friendliest communist stooge. But I still felt less-than-free inside that museum.

Maybe that was the real exhibit. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to see what Ai Weiwei thought about China, but feel it. Life, after all, is an experience.
