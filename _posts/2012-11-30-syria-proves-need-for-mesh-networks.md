On November 29, 2012, [Internet connectivity in Syria died](http://www.renesys.com/blog/2012/11/syria-off-the-air.shtml). Presumably the Syrian government flipped a kill switch, hoping to disrupt rebel communications in the country.

The thought that a government could simply decide to turn off the Internet is deeply troubling. [Social media played an important role](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#Effect_of_social_media_on_the_Arab_Spring) in organizing Arab Spring protesters. The Internet is an important tool to highlight and oppose government abuses of power across the world. Unfortunately, its physical infrastructure creates bottlenecks that governments like Syria’s can use to throttle the free flow of information. By controlling the few large telecoms in the country, Syria can control most digital communications.

How to solve the bottleneck problem? My hope is the development and widespread deployment of wireless [mesh networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). Unlike current Internet infrastructure, mesh networks couldn’t be cut off at physical bottlenecks. Each device on the network is a relay, receiving and forwarding flows of data. Take out one node, and the flow is simply rerouted through others. Using wireless technology to create the mesh means that nodes can be located anywhere, and relocated easily.

There are serious engineering problems to be solved before mesh networking is practical. For a lot of day-to-day Internet usage, the current infrastructure would be preferable. Sending data across untold small nodes with less bandwidth than the physical infrastructure built by major telecoms isn’t practical for all purposes. Security is also an issue when your data is hopping across nodes you know nothing about. Malicious nodes could intercept potentially sensitive data. But it’s decentralized nature could still make it viable when faced with a lack of large physical infrastructure, such as when governments flip an Internet kill switch.

Lots of mesh network projects currently exist, and I’m excited to see where they go. There’s even a group based in DC working on their own mesh network software: [Project Byzantium](http://project-byzantium.org/). It’s a Linux distro that could help people dive straight into using mesh networks. I haven’t tried it yet, but I may test it out. The trouble with projects like this is that only the very tech-savvy can understand how it works. Mesh networking isn’t as the point where, much like an Apple product, someone can just dive straight in and intuit how things work. It will be hard to implement, for dissidents or others, until it reaches that point.

But even with current limitations, I’m hopeful that mesh networks will help digital communications adapt to the growing threat of government control.
