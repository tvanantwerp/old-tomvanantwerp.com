I just finished reading [*The Cost of Engagement: Politics and Participatory Practices in the U.S. Liberty Movement*](http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/sites/all/files/publications/The_Cost_of_Engagement-Working_Paper-MAPP_12.10.12.pdf), a new academic study of young libertarians and their methods of communication and activism by Liana Gamber Thompson. On the whole, it seems like a fair look at young libertarians, what they actually believe, and how they work with each other for social change. I particularly enjoyed this quote from one of the interviewees, identified only as Rusty:

> I don’t believe in civic engagement. I think it’s probably more harm than good. I believe in a world where we can be totally ignorant of politics and it’s okay, because it doesn’t matter. You can live your life and it will be great and whoever wins the next election will not have any impact on what you’re doing. That’s kind of what I want to see. I don’t want to see people get politically involved. I want to see people get politically uninvolved. I want the politicians to know they are not important. We don’t like them, we don’t want them around, go away.

The study goes on to comment:

> While it is safe to assume that Rusty’s statement is largely hyperbolic, his take on the brokenness of electoral politics and his general disillusionment with politicians was not at all unique.

> Some of the interviewee’s assertions about hoping people get less politically involved are rather troubling, and the same could be said for young libertarians’ disavowal of the political system more generally.

From my own everyday dealing with libertarians, I can say two things with certainty.

1. Disengagement with ineffective and corrupt political processes is heartening, not troubling.
2. [Rusty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Gribble#Rusty_Shackleford) was almost certainly not exaggerating his opinion. I believe he meant every word.
