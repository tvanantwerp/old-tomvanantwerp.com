I can I can hardly believe it. I finished a video game! I completed my first Ludum Dare game last night with about 2 hours to spare. In two weeks, I went from zero knowledge of game development to building a fully functional game. I’ve titled my Ludum Dare #30 entry Falling Upwards, and [you can play it here](http://tvanantwerp.github.io/ludum-dare-30/web/falling-upwards.html). If you like it (or hate it), [leave me some feedback and/or votes at Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=38872).

I confess a feeling of fatherly pride to see my creation out in the world. I’ll admit, it’s probably not the best game ever made. I only had time for one level, and it’s fairly short. There is no audio, and the controls aren’t terribly responsive. But all that said, [it meets the goals I set for myself](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/make-video-game-two-weeks/) two weeks ago. The game runs, takes input, creates results that inform the next input, and incorporates that awful “connected worlds” theme. When I began preparing for Ludum Dare, I wasn’t sure if I could learn enough in time to finish an entire game. And during the first day of competition, I had strong doubts. But I’ve proven to myself that even in as short a time as two weeks, I’m capable of learning and creating a lot.

Ludum Dare has inspired me to attempt more ambitious goals in two-week sprints. Let’s call it agile personal development.

This has been an emotional process. Submitting my game resulted in an initial wave of relief. But within five minutes, I came back down through the realization that I didn’t really have anyone to share my success with. My wife was out and didn’t come home for a few hours. And when she did come home, she played for maybe five minutes before giving up. She really hates video games. Since [quitting Facebook](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/quitting-facebook/), I don’t have anyone there to share with. I called my mom to tell her, and she was happy. But she’s mom, she doesn’t really understand games, and she would be happy about anything I did. I got the most love and support from strangers on Twitter who favorited my tweets about the game. As happy as I am with myself, I’ve also been quite sad that the joy of fulfilling a childhood dream is something that I can’t really share with anyone.

If you play my game to the end, I think you might understand how I’ve felt in a small way.
