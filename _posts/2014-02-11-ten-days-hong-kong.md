Last night I returned from my 10-day trip to Hong Kong. It’s the first time I’ve been since 2010, and I loved every minute of it. Valerie’s family is wonderful, and I hope to see them again soon. And despite the fact that it was my shortest visit yet, I still learned a lot. In no particular order, these were my biggest takeaways:

* **In the near future, cell phones will be the size of your face.**
I saw very few people using iPhones in Hong Kong. What I did see were many, many enormous smartphones. Beasts like the Samsung Galaxy Mega and the Sony Xperia Z were common. This is the future, guys. I hope you’ve got  big pockets.
* **Chinese New Year is the most boring time to visit China.**
The Chinese New Year sounds like it would be a raucous party. Instead, it’s a week where everyone goes home to visit family for a week or two. Imagine Thanksgiving if it lasted for 10 days and was never followed up by Black Friday. Sure, it’s fun at first. But pretty soon, you get tired of every shop being closed and overeating at every meal.
* **Life without the 24-hour news cycle is incredible.**
Hong Kong is too small to warrant 24/7 news. And what news they do have is refreshingly devoid of talking heads. Every time I checked Facebook to see what was happening back home, the stupid “stories” and the political spin on everything made me sick. I could definitely live without American news culture.
* **People are the same everywhere.**
Lots of people like to make a big deal of cultural, political, and ethnic differences. They can differentiate people, yes, but mostly at the margins. Living with Valerie’s family was little different than living with my own. Her mother, though she speaks no English and grew up in Mao’s China, is still very much a mom. She serves way more food than necessary, will do your laundry for you, and always insists you wear a coat outside when the temperature drops by a quarter of a degree. Very typical mom stuff. More broadly, you will find every type of person in every place on Earth. The distributions may vary, but we’ve all got much more in common than not.
