Tomorrow is my last day to practice before a very intense 48 hours of Ludum Dare. I’m sure I’ll be excited, frustrated, exhausted, and emotional. Sounds like fun!

I’m making progress on my practice Flappy Bird clone and learning a lot of little tricks I could use, such as how to script background scrolling and player death. Basic stuff, but all new to me. I’ve enjoyed the tutorials by quill18, though I’m becoming increasingly frustrated with [this Flappy Bird series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbghT7MmckI4Sazzc4bB3s6ZLIRbGrNyn). It’s become a lot of stream of consciousness and debugging unexpected errors. That’s what building programs is. I don’t hold that against him, as it’s what I spend most of every day doing at work. But it’s really annoying for a series of tutorials. I’ve been spending half my time erasing things I built while following his example because he changed his mind mid-video. A little editing would’ve been nice. I’m contemplating doing my own version of this tutorial next week, but with a working clone in hand to use as reference.
