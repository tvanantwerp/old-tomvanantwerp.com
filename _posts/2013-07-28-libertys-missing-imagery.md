I do lots of freelance design work, often for libertarians. Graphic design, though a wonderful pursuit, is challenging. It takes lots of technical skill and abstract creativity to envision a great design and bring it to life—especially on a deadline. This challenge is even more difficult when designing for libertarians. Why? Because there are only so many times you can slap Lady Liberty onto something before it’s trite.

Liberty is an idea without a robust visual language. It’s a challenge I face with every single design I make for libertarians, and it never gets easier. And I’m not sure how to make it easier.

Libertarian philosophy is itself a largely negative concept. I don’t mean that in the sense that it’s bad or depressing, but that it’s largely defined by the absence of something rather than the presence of something. We often describe libertarian society as one that has *less* government, *less* coercion, *less* war, and *less* oppression.

Contrast that with an idea like socialism. It’s a very positive idea—again, not in the good or happy sense, but in the sense that it describes specific additions to the world rather than subtractions. While I would argue that socialism’s actual additions are not the ones which its supporters intend, it’s not hard to visualize that world they’re trying to create. Imagine hammers and sickles, raised fists and united workers. And they’re symbols that make sense, even if you don’t know the context. It speaks directly to the goals of the ideology: a world where everyone has an equal share of labor and an equal reward from it.

How do you visualize liberty? The Statue of Liberty is the most obvious symbol. You’ve also got bald eagles and the Liberty Bell. If you want to go *way* back, you can use those [ridiculous felt hats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_cap) they gave to freed slaves in ancient Rome. Aside from this, there’s not much to choose from. And it’s all specific to a certain cultural context. If I’d never seen Lady Liberty before and didn’t know what she was supposed to represent, I would guess she’s an arsonist who dresses in bed sheets. Because liberty is a negative concept, it ranges from difficult to impossible to represent it with comprehensible imagery.

The ideas of liberty must be communicated widely, and imagery is just as important as writing. We need more art, more symbols, and a clearer *vision* of a libertarian world.

I don’t think I’m the guy who is going to develop the timeless iconography of libertarianism. But I hope to contribute, one design at a time, to finding the images that work.

I’ll be banging my head on the desk, searching desperately for inspiration, while I do.
