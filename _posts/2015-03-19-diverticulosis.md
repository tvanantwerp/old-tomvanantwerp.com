A few weeks ago I went to the emergency room with abdominal pains and left with a diagnosis: [diverticulosis](http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/diverticulosis-topic-overview). It’s a condition that most people get eventually, but typically not until old age. Small pouches have formed in the wall of my colon which are susceptible to inflammation and infection (called [diverticulitis](http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/diverticulitis-topic-overview)). There is no cure for this condition; the pouches are permanent, barring a colon resection. I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to prevent infection and minimize further damage to my colon.

This has been a nerve-wracking experience for me. Very suddenly, I’m being forced to make drastic changes to my lifestyle. I thought I had another decade or two of occasional reckless eating. But now I risk permanent bodily harm unless I stick to a high-fiber diet and avoid many of my favorite foods. I’m sure I’ll be, on net, healthier; but I won’t be happier.

Also, the fear of complications (which can be fatal) has forced me to think a lot about my own mortality. I hope to have a good career, buy a house, raise a family, and see my children become happy and successful. For the first time, I have to seriously ask myself if the life I’ve worked for is still attainable. [Despite my techno-optimism](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1968), I’m still pretty sure that I’m going to be irrevocably dead one day. I can deal with that; it’s not like I have a choice. But I can’t deal with the thought of not having accomplished so many life goals. Life is more outside of my own control than I’d like.

I’ve also experienced a lot of jealousy and anger. All the Facebook photos of  friends’ delicious meals are driving me nuts. It feels so unfair that I can’t be part of that anymore. I never thought my diet was much worse than the average American; it’s probably better than most from my hometown. And yet *I* have the busted colon, and everyone else gets to savor whatever tasty morsels they like. One of life’s greatest joys—food!—now seems forbidden exclusively to me, and I hate that.

As time has passed since the diagnosis, pain has been fading and I’ve been able to eat a bit more normally. I’ve lost over ten pounds since this began. Some optimism, and even a sense of normalcy, is returning to me. I believe things will get better. But this will always be something I have to think about, wondering if I’ll be thrown back into a bout of pain and depression—or worse.
