Yesterday [I complained a bit](/nonprofits-are-businesses-too/) about donors who unfairly judge nonprofits with higher overhead expenses. Nonprofits should be judged primarily on results, not cost structure. When I buy a stock, I look for growing revenues and juicy margins. In other words, I want to see growth and effectiveness. Donors should judge nonprofits likewise.

Today I’m going to flip the tables and complain about something stupid that nonprofits do. This post was inspired by a conversation I was having, not with a nonprofit, but with someone sympathetic to the libertarian causes that I (and the nonprofit I work for) support. He was looking to hire a web designer for cheap, and said:

> …my thinking (however naive and counter to pure market theory) is that perhaps some established or aspiring web designer … might be willing to lend her talents to my project at a below-market rate for the good of the cause.

He’s right: that *does* run counter to market theory. And this is the general attitude—including at libertarian nonprofits (who supposedly champion markets!)—that nonprofits have toward the labor market.

Working for a cause you love with like-minded people is a substantial non-monetary benefit of nonprofit work. And maybe they’re willing to work for less-than-market wages when they’re young and enthusiastic and ready to change the world. But give it a couple of years. Let them watch their private sector friends surpass them one at a time. Let them stop and look at their life in their mid-thirties, still renting a row house with four other people and living like a college student. Let them realize that they still spend about 50% of their income on rent, and another quarter on beer and Chinese take-out. Maybe that’s the dream for some, but I doubt it’s the dream for most. It’s a recipe for bitter resentment and a massive loss of potential talent for the nonprofit sector.

Returning to the point I made yesterday, nonprofits are businesses too. Businesses must compete for top talent in a very competitive labor market. Acquiring and keeping that talent can get expensive. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, every nonprofit I’ve ever encountered thinks they deserve this talent at a discount. Nonprofits are special—endowed with some saintly quality—that exempts them from the cruel forces of the market and the competition for scarce resources.

Sorry, but it does not work that way.

Most people want to have as high a standard of living as they can get. Even if they’re in love with the cause, they still want to make a decent living. How many talented, passionate people have left—or never been part of—nonprofits for this reason. The most highly skilled individuals don’t want to stagnate at a nonprofit. They have a very high opportunity cost associated with taking a pay cut for the good of the cause, and they know it. Even if their naïve enthusiasm blinds them to that fact for some time, it won’t forever.

Nonprofits lose out by rejecting the fact that they must compensate their talent at market rates.
