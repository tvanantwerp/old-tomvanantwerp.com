I recently read [this op-ed](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/libertarianism-for-social-conservatives-231/) from Jack Hunter, a professional Paulite (no offense intended, I just don’t know a better way to say it), about why social conservatives should embrace libertarianism. I’m all for more libertarian advocacy from anybody, but I’ve got a few criticisms of Jack’s piece.

1. Federalism isn’t libertarianism, and this article confuses the two. States rights may be preferable to the alternative of the Federal one-size-fits-all-poorly approach. It’s certainly more Constitutional. But even then, some state-level decisions will restrict freedom more than the Federal government does. Local statism isn’t preferable to national statism, and it’s not libertarian.
2. The overlap of libertarians and conservatives happened through an accident of history more than a natural alignment of interests. During the Cold War, early libertarians—few in number and without influence—were legitimately concerned about communism and found more allies among the right than the left. This was a time before the collapse of the USSR and before the religious right gained such influence over the GOP. But after the economic and social statism of the Bush years, it’s no longer clear that the old alliances benefit libertarians. Social conservatives on the right have alienated many of the groups who could most benefit from libertarianism made manifest: immigrants, homosexuals, drug users, non-Christians, etc. Does it do libertarians any good to be associated with the conservative brand?
3. There is a big distinction between conservatism in your own life, and a belief in creating a conservative society through government. If you choose to live according to “traditional” (whatever that means) values, but force them on no one, then sure, you can be libertarian too. If you support federalism because you think 25 states with laws restricting behavior according to your values is better than one national government preventing any such restriction, then you certainly are not libertarian. When most people talk about social conservatives, they are thinking of the second type of person. That’s why I often cringe when people say: “You can be both conservative and libertarian!” I know that they mean the first guy, who just lives a certain way peacefully. But I fear other people will not understand that statement in the same way.
I am, on the whole, glad to see the GOP trending libertarian. But as a libertarian, I’m also afraid that people who are just being introduced to these ideas will be turned off by an association with social conservatism.Young people today are very socially liberal. If libertarianism is popularly thought of as just some tool of social conservatism, it will alienate many young people unnecessarily.

[Students For Liberty](http://studentsforliberty.org/), one of my favorite libertarian groups ever, asked their members what their political beliefs were before libertarianism. It was roughly an even split between conservatism, liberalism and people who were simply always libertarian. This is a very new development, and it highlights libertarianism’s potential to erode support for statism in both the left and the right. To focus solely on alliances with conservatives to advance an agenda of liberty would be a mistake.
