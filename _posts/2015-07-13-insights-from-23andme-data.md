I previously complained about [the FDA preventing 23andMe from sharing health information with their customers](http://tomvanantwerp.com/23andnotme/). This caused me to put off trying 23andMe for quite a while, but curiosity inevitably got the best of me. And despite the FDA's best attempts to prevent me from trying to learn more about myself, I managed to get a third-party health screening of my 23andMe data from [Promethease](https://promethease.com/ondemandagreed), which is based on data from [SNPedia](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia). While there is certainly room for error in these results, what I did find out was enlightening.

While I have several genotypes that increase risk of various diseases, they have a relatively low impact. No major red flags screaming "You will definitely get terminal illness X!" I've got just as many genes with similar impact that make me less prone to other diseases. I'm calling it a wash.

Some results were not surprising in the slightest. For example, [I am a pale white person who burns in sunlight](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1393350(A;A)). Others weren't expected, but are very interesting anyway. [I don't metabolize caffeine very quickly](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs762551(A;C)), which would keep me stimulated longer.

The most interesting genotypes to me were ones affecting my capacity for joy.

The genotype with the strongest magnitude is one for [fewer D2 dopamine receptors in the brain](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1800497(T;T)). Another one of my genotypes also results in [decreased dopamine availability](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4680). This has lots of implications, but it basically means that I have diminished ability to experience pleasure. Some research shows that people with fewer D2 dopamine receptors are [more likely to exhibit addictive behavior](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/14/health/genetic-studies-promise-a-path-to-better-treatment-of-addictions.html) as a response to the blunting of simple pleasures.

People with my genotype are more likely to become obese, to drink and smoke, and to become addicts. This may partly explain why [I'm so addicted to video games](http://tomvanantwerp.com/addiction/) and why I have trouble preventing myself from eating whether I'm full or not. Moderation is not a virtue I exercise well.

Of course, I won't let one crappy genotype won't determine my fate. You won't find me curled up on the floor of an opium den. But it is good to know that I've got certain limitations. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to effectively find ways to work around them. Mice studies have shown that [exercise can increased dopamine receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273304/) in the brain. If I work harder to incorporate physical activity into my life, it can help offset my genes and bring me closer to a normal experience. I also know that I should probably stay very far away from any drugs with a strong potential for addiction.

It's still weird to think about myself as someone who has trouble experience small pleasures, but I'm glad I've got the hard data to make that clear. Otherwise it might be too tempting to overindulge myself in search of gratification. Armed with specific knowledge about my genome, I can plan around the weaknesses I'm stuck with.
