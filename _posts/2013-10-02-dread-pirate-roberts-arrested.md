Earlier today, [FBI agents seized the Silk Road](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feds-shut-down-silk-road-arrest-alleged-admin-dread-pirate-roberts/)—the Tor hidden services site where “anonymous” users bought and sold drugs with bitcoin—and arrested the man alleged to be running it, Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts.

While I never used the service, it’s still a sad end to what was very explicitly a libertarian enterprise. [Dread Pirate Roberts was known for his libertarian views](/the-political-philosophy-of-a-crypto-kingpin/), and saw Silk Road not just as a business but as a way to make the world a freer place.

While it’s not yet known how the FBI identified and arrested Ross Ulbricht, it really shouldn’t come as a surprise. While Tor can help one to remain anonymous against limited adversaries, [it’s not useful against dragnet surveillance like the kind conducting by the US government](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/tor-is-less-anonymous-than-you-think). [Bitcoin, likewise, isn’t truly anonymous either](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-27/bitcoin-may-not-be-so-anonymous-after-all). In the face of such all-encompassing data interception, [privacy is effectively impossible](/the-end-of-all-secrets/). And after facing adversaries like Edward Snowden and, now, Ulbricht, it’s not unlikely that [libertarian individuals will be under greater scrutiny](/will-libertarians-be-the-nsas-next-targets/).

Remember, friends of liberty: you are being watched. Stay safe, stay paranoid.

> **Update 1**: Some friends are telling me that, among the charges from the FBI, is that [DPR hired a hitman to kill someone who tried to extort him](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/10/02/feds-shut-down-silk-road-owner-known-as-dread-pirate-roberts-arrested/). That’s very unfortunate if true, and certainly erases any hero status he may have otherwise earned. We’ll have to wait and see how this case unfolds. Regardless, my points about the dangers of surveillance online stand.

> **Update 2**: Is [this](https://www.facebook.com/rossulbricht) Dread Pirate Roberts? Seems so.
>
> **Update 3**: Holy crap, this is nuts. [Read the criminal complaint against Ulbricht](http://www.scribd.com/doc/172764080/Ulbricht-Criminal-Complaint), and skip to page 21 to read about the alleged hit he paid for. It’s like an episode of Breaking Bad! This guy may have started out with noble intentions, but just like Walter White, he became (allegedly) a monster.

> **Update 4**: [Ulbricht is looking more and more like a murderous drug lord](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feds-silkroad-boss-paid-80000-for-snitchs-murder-and-torture/) rather than peaceful crypto-anarchist revolutionary. This is why libertarians can’t have nice things!
