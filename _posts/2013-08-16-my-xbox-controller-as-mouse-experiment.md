For a couple of months now, I’ve been suffering from pain in my right wrist. It’s no mystery that it’s the result of using a mouse during nearly every waking hour of my life. I’ve been using a wrist brace to help, but it’s no longer sufficient. I want to give my poor wrist a rest so it can heal by itself—it certainly feels better on days I don’t use it much—but it’s hard when your livelihood depends on click, click, clicking away all day. Since I can’t stop using the computer, I’ve devised an experiment to eliminate most of the pressure on my wrist while still completing most tasks. I’ve replaced my mouse with an Xbox controller.

Ok, so, not exactly replaced. I still have the mouse, and it’s technically and off-brand Xbox controller. Still, I’ve been using this controller for maybe 90% of my computer use so far today, and it’s working well! I used to be a hardcore gamer, and I know from experience that a controller doesn’t hurt me like a mouse can. I’ll have to keep using it for a few days at least to get a good sense of whether or not this will work, but I’m optimistic.

The set-up wasn’t too hard. I bought a wired GameStop brand Xbox 360 controller last night for $25, and I’ve plugged it into my work PC. Since the Xbox 360 uses USB, it works well on a PC and Windows doesn’t have trouble figuring out how to use it. The I downloaded [JoyToKey](http://www.electracode.com/4/joy2key/JoyToKey%20English%20Version.htm), a standalone program that let me do basic controller configuration. There’s another program I like more that I tried at home last night: [Xpadder](http://www.xpadder.com/). That one, however, costs money, and I was in a rush this morning and didn’t bring a copy. Xpadder is easy to configure for Xbox controllers than JoyToKey, but both work for my limited needs.

I mapped the left stick to mouse movements. A is left click, B is right click, and X is middle-click. With JoyToKey, I created multiple configuration profiles where the only difference is the cursor speed associated with the left stick, and then set up the left and right bumpers to toggle those profiles on or off. This way, I can control cursor speed as if left bumper were a gas pedal and right bumper were the brakes.

Obviously, this setup isn’t a total replacement for my mouse. I still need it for finely detailed work, such as digital illustration. But the controller easily covers most web browsing, email checking, and other simple but routine tasks. Using the controller today has been easy and pain-free. I’m excited to see how this works out, and I’ll follow up with details of whether the experiment works or not.

> **Follow-Up**: The Xbox controller helped a bit. But what ultimately helped the most was wearing a properly-fitting wrist brace every night while I sleep. My wrist still isn’t 100% after 10 months, and may never be again. But it’s in much better shape than it was. Also, I recommend that no one who wants to use a standing desk half-ass it. That’s what sped up the deterioration in my wrist thanks to a bad angle while working. If you want to try a standing desk, you should just pay the money for a proper one. Don’t jerry-rig it.
