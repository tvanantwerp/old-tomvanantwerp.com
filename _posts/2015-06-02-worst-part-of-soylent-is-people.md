After I discovered that I had [diverticular disease](http://tomvanantwerp.com/diverticulosis/), I started looking for ways to modify my diet to prevent further degeneration of my colon. Soylent, which is smooth-ish and has plenty of fiber, seemed like a reasonable alternative to the junk I was eating previously. So I ordered a month's worth of the stuff and started using it daily. Then every other day. Then maybe once or twice a week. Now I've got boxes of the stuff, and I'm not sure if I'll ever use it. But it's not because I don't like it. I mean, I *don't* like it, but I don't *hate* it either. It's just overwhelmingly bland. And I haven't stopped for any of the reasons [it's not that convenient](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8590673/soylent), though I certainly agree with them. The main reason I've stopped using it is because of other people, who are neither understanding nor supportive of my attempt to replace food.

It took a while to understand that this was the reason that I had largely stopped using Soylent. I knew I was tired of the questions, the weird looks, the professed revulsion, and the jokes. Then I read [Eliezer Yudkowsky's piece on lonely dissent](http://lesswrong.com/lw/mb/lonely_dissent/), and everything clicked.

If I had become a vegetarian in response to illness, nobody would have thought twice. People might even congratulate me for improving my diet and share some recipes. But Soylent? Replacing meals with nutrient goop *à la* The Matrix? There's no precedent for that. No one supports that decision. Nobody understands why you've made *that* choice. And nobody cares to figure it out.

> Lonely dissent doesn't feel like going to school dressed in black. It feels like going to school wearing a clown suit.

For those who haven't experienced that feeling in a while, let me assure you that it sucks. Start drinking Soylent if you don't believe me.
