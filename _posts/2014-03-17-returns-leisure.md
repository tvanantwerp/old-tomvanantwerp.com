(This is part 1 of 2. [See Part 2 here.](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/returns-leisure-part-2/))

This morning I had a thought: of all my leisure activities, which one has the highest return on investment? In other words, I want to know how much quality leisure time do I enjoy per dollar spent for various activities?

My initial suspicion is video games. I bought an Xbox 360 during Black Friday, and have  been downloading old games on Xbox Live for discounted prices. I’ve been a non-gamer for a few years now, and there’s plenty of older, cheaper content for me to catch up on. I’m also a bit of a gaming addict, so I can play any given game for lengths of time that probably aren’t healthy.

Now, being a firm believer in empiricism, I won’t just accept my hypothesis as truth. I’ve decided to actually track my leisure time over the next couple of weeks, as well as related expenditures, to see what really is the best bang for my buck in terms of fun.

My methodology is as follows: I will be using [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track the time spent on different leisure activities. I’ve already been using it for tracking freelance hours, so I know how it works and won’t have to work hard to track things. I’ll also be supplementing this data with [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/), which can tell me how much time I’ve spent on different sites/programs while on a computer. I already track and categorize expenditures in [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), so that will also be easy.

I’ve written a few assumptions to help me make sense of my data:

* All time spent on a leisure activity is time enjoyed, or else I wouldn’t be doing it.
* Any time spent on leisure is spent on the highest valued activity available to me at the moment, or else I would be doing something different.
* No leisure activity is costless; there are always opportunity costs. (I’m unsure how to measure these, but I’m considering using hourly income from either work or freelance jobs as a proxy.)
