My friend and coworker [Dan Carvajal](https://twitter.com/dan_v_c) brought a bag of [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) into the office and split it with me for lunch today. I’ve been wanting to try it for a while, but it’s been impossible to get my hands on any. I guess meal replacement logistics don’t scale as well as [SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). After drinking nearly 500mL of the stuff, I know that I’m not ready for the future of food just yet.

In fairness, Soylent wasn’t that bad. I have attempted various veggie smoothies that were far worse. But Soylent isn’t that great either. If you want to get a sense of the flavor without waiting half a year for your first shipment, buy some vanilla whey protein powder, mix a cup of it with water, and add a tablespoon of fish oil. The oil is what makes the flavor especially odd, and several coworkers were vocal about the awful smell of it. Before adding the oil, Dan said the powder smelled like Lucky Charms marshmallows.

For a drink, Soylent is extremely filling. In the middle of writing this blog post, Dan walked into my office and asked: “Are you experiencing a prolonged discomfort?” While I wouldn’t say I’m uncomfortable, I’m definitely very full. It’s been two hours and it feels like a brick in my gut. I’m actually disappointed by how full I am, because now I can’t eat any real food to remind me what flavor is.

My very first experience with Soylent has been their extreme lag times in shipping. I was a backer of their original crowdfunding campaign, but asked for my money back when, a year on, there were no signs of progress. Once they finally started shipping and selling, I decided to sign up again. I waited the estimated 3 months, only to log in one day and discover a new shipping estimate of 5 months. Now that I’ve tried Soylent and know what I’m waiting for, I’ve cancelled again.

If Soylent aims to be a food replacement, it’s got a long way to go. The only market it might serve right now is early adopters who are obsessed with efficiency and optimization. The wait times are too long for the merely curious, and the price and flavor are not low enough and high enough, respectively, to entice [poor people who have no time to prepare full meals](/poor-dont-need-nice-food/). Cheap, fast, and good; Soylent is none of them. If I were choosing between this and a case of Twinkies, the Twinkies would always win.

I hope Soylent will get better with time. At present, it’s not for me.
