How exactly did the FBI catch Ross Ulbricht, the alleged Dread Pirate Roberts of Silk Road infamy? I have sincere doubts that we can ever know with certainty. The Edward Snowden leaks indicated that [law enforcement employs parallel construction to conceal the true source of their information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction). So even if the FBI lays out it’s investigation process in open court, there’s a chance it’s only a plausible fiction concealing the truth.

Early details indicate that the interception of fake IDs en route to Ulbricht helped to give him away. (Pro-tip #1: Mailing forged documents to your home is stupid.) They also found IP address evidence linking Ulbricht to Silk Road’s back end, and[ were able to link several online identities to Ulbricht](http://gawker.com/meet-silk-roads-alleged-drug-lord-a-29-year-old-calif-1440275594). (Pro-tip #2: Use throwaway personas, don’t become a symbol.) Whether they gathered information on the package or Ulbricht’s Internet behavior through dragnet surveillance or good luck in sleuthing may never be known.

Regardless of the unknowable details, it’s clear the Ulbricht was insufficiently paranoid. His growing public profile made him a greater target for law enforcement, which meant that the likelihood of them discovering mistakes he’d made continued to grow. Any small combination of forgetfulness, laziness, bad luck, error or unreliable associates can create these breadcrumb trails that will inevitably lead back to the original actor.

There are a lot of people in the world who have a legitimate need to remain anonymous, such as political dissidents working against dictatorships. There’s a lesson for them to be learned from Ulbricht: [anonymity is hard, bordering on impossible](/the-end-of-all-secrets/).

> **Update**: For those wanting to see a timeline of all of Ulbricht’s mistakes, start reading [this](http://www.scribd.com/doc/172764080/Ulbricht-Criminal-Complaint) criminal complaint at page 24. Again, no guarantee that this was an actual part of the investigation and not an instance of parallel construction. But if it is all accurate anyway, then it still is a great example for how you can build a digital profile that identifies you despite your best efforts at secrecy.
