description: "I acknowledge that shame, like any weapon, is value-neutral. As it can be employed by libertarians against those who would use physical force against innocent people, it can also be employed by bigots and statists. But it’s no use to decry shaming itself. Employing emotions to make your opponents feel bad is still far preferable to gunfire. Despite the fact that many use shame to disparage those who don’t deserve it, it’s still a useful tool against the far greater threat of mass violence and death."

I recently read [this piece](http://thoughtsonliberty.com/shaming-others-is-unjustifiable-coercion) by Cathy Reisenwitz, which definitely made me do a double-take. I’ve read other pieces by her against slut-shaming, and those make sense to me. I personally don’t care what sexual choices any given individual makes, with the exception of my wife. (It seems weird to have to explicitly state this, but our marriage is 100% monogamous and we mutually understand that.) But I completely disagree that trying to make others feel ashamed for their actions is coercion. To claim so both trivializes real coercion and declares *verboten* a powerful tool for maintaining important social norms non-violently.

Cathy invites naysayers, correctly:

> Instead of threatening me with criticism, ridicule, shame, and sometimes complete ostracization, sell me on your view.

OK, I’ll give it a go.

I won’t deny the fact that the use of shaming and actual coercion can go together. For a recent contemporary example, look at how homosexuals are treated in Russia. The Russian state makes persecution of homosexuals official policy, and encourages private individuals to shame (or worse) known LGBTQ individuals. People who employ shame a lot can definitely overlap with people who employ physical coercion a lot. However, shame and state coercion need not overlap; in fact, shame can be a powerful weapon against coercion.

Looking up “shame” on dictionary.com, I find four definitions of the noun (i.e., the feeling) before coming across the verb (i.e., the action). (I can’t be sure that’s not alphabetical order bias, but let’s run with it.) The first definition is: “the painful feeling arising from the consciousness of something dishonorable, improper, ridiculous, etc., done by oneself or another”. While inflicting pain is generally a libertarian no-no, it’s important to note here that this pain is felt as a result of one’s own actions. This is where shame becomes something of potential value for libertarians. Many actions taken by the state are, in our own reckoning, immoral. The War on Drugs, drone-bombing children, civil asset forfeiture, mass surveillance, and much more. To feel ashamed means that you understand your actions as “dishonorable, improper, ridiculous, etc.” I can’t think of a better description for much of what the State does.

Like I said earlier, I don’t much care what you do in your bedroom or whom you do it with. But I do care when a TSA officer cups my balls, and he ought to feel ashamed. I care when a technician at the NSA copies all of my communications, and he ought to feel ashamed. I care when cops pepper-spray non-violent protestors, and they should feel ashamed. Many, many people employing real, physical coercion against non-violent people across the world ought to be deeply ashamed. And we, people who care about freedom, need to let them know that we don’t accept what they do and we don’t accept them into our human community. Shame is the only peaceful tool we have against such individuals right now.

Edward Snowden saw what the NSA wanted him to do, felt ashamed, and chose to reveal the hidden coercion of the surveillance state. Many others, largely nameless, will leave government “service” out of shame. How many draft-dodgers (a.k.a., the sane) were too ashamed to be part of the war in Vietnam? How many in the armed forces today, faced with the possibility of fighting in Syria, are ashamed and willing to voice their opposition? Those who work in the service of real physical coercion on a massive scale ought to be brought to feel shame at every opportunity. That emotional pain, however unpleasant, is all that can steer them toward a better path in life.

Lots of Nazis tried, unsuccessfully, to defend their actions with the excuse that they were just following orders. Feeling shame is a good way to intuit that your orders are bullshit.

I acknowledge that shame, like any weapon, is value-neutral. As it can be employed by libertarians against those who would use physical force against innocent people, it can also be employed by bigots and statists. But it’s no use to decry shaming itself. Employing emotions to make your opponents feel bad is still far preferable to gunfire. Despite the fact that many use shame to disparage those who don’t deserve it, it’s still a useful tool against the far greater threat of mass violence and death.

Cathy closes:

> Coercion comes in many forms. There is no need or sufficient justification for coercion as a response to cooperative behavior.

Naturally. But not all behavior is cooperative, and coercive behavior itself is worthy of shame.

I think that what Cathy wanted to make clear was, that it’s wrong to shame people for non-violent behavior that doesn’t affect any non-consenting parties. I agree with that. But not all shame is wrong—sometimes it is well earned. It’s absolutely worth discussing what activities deserve to be shamed or not, but I disagree with denouncing all shaming. To feel shame is an important part of learning to be human. To feel shame is to know that another is emotionally hurt by your actions, justly or not. Shame guides us to making important decisions about how to live with the broader community which is humanity.

To never feel shame at all is psychopathy.
