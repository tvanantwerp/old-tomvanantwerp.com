On August 18, 2015, [hackers leaked the personal data of millions of accounts at Ashely Madison](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/happened-hackers-posted-stolen-ashley-madison-data/), a website known for facilitating extramarital affairs. It's likely that many marriages are now in shambles. Very private secrets, whether or not they deserved to be kept, are now very public.

We all generate massive amounts of data and metadata about our lives. Secrets--like those kept by Ashley Madison--are easier than ever to unearth. Whether a hacker leaks damning information, or someone puts together the pieces we've left lying around, there is little we can hide from the world anymore. The state of digital security is a joke. Privacy is effectively dead.

The long-term consequences of this proliferation of once-private information will transform society in one of two ways.

## Scenario #1: We Will Learn to Accept Many More Lifestyles Than in the Past

As the saying goes, "Those in glass houses ought not throw stones."

In a future where everyone is publicly exposed, we will have to truly face humanity's diversity, weirdness, and weakness. When all our strange and conflicting subjective preferences are brought to light, we will be forced to agree to disagree.

The Ashley Madison hack is a warning: secrets no longer work. When would-be adulterers know that secret affairs cannot possibly remain secret, many couples will be forced to actually confront their issues. Lack of intimacy? Polyamorous desires? Whatever the problem, it will need to be faced head-on. Some marriages may end quicker. Some may push the boundaries of contemporary taboos. Imagine more marriages that are open, and public about it. There may even be group marriages. Or perhaps marriage as an institution will largely dissolve as people admit to themselves that they don't want such a stringent commitment. Whatever happens, marriage will be redefined out of necessity to maintain the participants' sanity.

Marriage won't be the only transformed institution in a world without secrets. All manner of human preferences will be more acceptable. Can you imagine, even twenty years ago, that a community of men could form around [enthusiasm for My Little Pony](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Brony)? It's already more acceptable for men to enjoy "feminine" things and for women to enjoy "masculine" things. Guilt for enjoying the "wrong" things will erode over time, and it will be easier for everyone to embrace anything that they truly enjoy.

## Scenario #2: Public Shaming and Mob Justice Will Create a Crowdsourced *1984*

We already live in a world where [a single out-of-context photograph is enough to ruin a person's life](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/18-silence-and-respect/). The Internet has enabled mean-spirited people with far too much time on their hands to institute mob justice at random. Any act that can be interpreted as offensive can make you a target for harassment and death threats.

In this future, individual expression is crushed by the pressure to conform. Unacceptable preferences and behaviors will be mercilessly shunned by countless strangers. We will all self-censor ourselves to avoid becoming targets. Everyone just tries to fit in. And with no privacy, either in public or at home, we will all be genuinely unable to explore ideas and desires outside of the accepted norm. Our inability to perform taboo acts may even diminish our ability to think taboo thoughts.

The future is **not** a boot stamping on a human face forever--it's millions of boots stamping in unison.

## Where Are We Going?

There is anecdotal evidence for both scenarios. We're very likely going to travel both roads at once, as contradictory as that seems. Some taboos will die, others will be born. It's strange to think that we might become radically free in some ways, and completely repressed in others. I'm not too worried where I am--in the US at least, it seems that varied lifestyles are becoming more acceptable while bigotry and hatred are increasingly targets of public shaming. But in countries where dissent of any kind, whether social, political, religious, or whatever, is already punished, things may turn out very badly.

It's too early to tell whether the complete erosion of privacy is something that we, as a species, will be able to deal with. Barring the collapse of global civilization, this will be the new normal from here on out. We're going to have to deal with it as best we can. I'm hopeful that more and more people will choose the live-and-let-live option.
