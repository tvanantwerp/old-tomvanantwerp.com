We don’t need a libertarian Reddit; we need to submit quality content to Reddit that drowns out the crazies. And we sure as hell don’t need a set of manuals for being libertarian; we should live freely where we can, and push for freedom where it’s absent with the best tactics available."

I recently discovered something awful. (No, not [that one](http://www.somethingawful.com/).) There’s a new campaign on Indiegogo to fund something called [Liberty.me](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/liberty-me--2). Lots of people I know seem really excited by this project, but I’m not. This is just another wasteful project to “build the libertarian X”, where X stands for something that both already exists and works perfectly well independent of your political philosophy.

Liberty.me has a long list of features, none of which are particularly unique. You’ll be able to publish your own content (just like WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and many others), earn “Liberty Karma” (just like Reddit Karma, or Facebook Likes, or Retweets/Favorites),  read classic libertarian books (just like at a library), and do many more totally unoriginal things. The only feature that appears new is that you’ll have to pay for access!

Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and many other companies have invested *billions* into making this kind of technology work. And I’m supposed to believe that Jeffrey Tucker and a posse of other “liberty experts” will be able to do the same with only $120,000? And even if they could, why should I **pay** to be part of a social network whose only unique feature is that my content is *less* likely to be seen by other people?

This is a classic example of the “we need a libertarian X” fallacy. We already have Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, a plethora of blogging platforms, and so many other tools. Most of them work amazingly well, and are totally free! The only difference between Liberty.me and the rest of them is that Liberty.me will be “pure”. It’s for libertarians only! But…how does that advance liberty? If a libertarian’s goal is to communicate the message of freedom as effectively and to as many as possible, why would she put her work behind a paywall? Why would she only want to preach to the converted? All Liberty.me could hope to do is reinforce the boundaries of the libertarian echo chamber. It’s needlessly exclusionary.

We don’t need libertarian social networks; we need to better use the social networks we have. We don’t need libertarian blogging platforms; we need to write better content for the blogging platforms available. We don’t need a libertarian Reddit; we need to submit quality content to Reddit that drowns out [the crazies](http://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian). And we sure as hell don’t need a set of manuals for being libertarian; we should live freely where we can, and push for freedom where it’s absent with the best tactics available.

Building the “libertarian X” is just another way of building the the libertarian echo chamber.

I want to see the world become a freer place. I hope you do too. If you really want to give money toward that end, here is an incomplete list of organizations which will be much more effective than Liberty.me could ever hope to be:
