description: "The truth is that Obama was never a tech-savvy politician. He was just the politician that, for various reasons, resonated with tech-savvy people. He’s played the Washington game just like any other politician. He was never about changing government for the better or innovating toward a bright new future—that’s what his hacker supporters were about, and he played them. Now they’re out in the cold, watching as the man they backed doubles-down on domestic spying and cronyism."

While I haven’t tried to use it myself (I’m thankfully insured by my employer), I keep hearing that [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) is a [total mess](http://reason.com/blog/2013/10/07/is-the-administration-misleading-people). This is in stark contrast to the [Obama campaign of 2012](/the-data-driven-political-machine/), which was the most technically savvy political campaign of all time. How could Healthcare.gov fail so miserably when Obama’s campaign was a masterpiece?

This has quite a few people scratching their heads. Wasn’t Obama the tech-savvy candidate? [Asks The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814098/why-did-the-tech-savvy-obama-administration-launch-a-busted-healthcare-website):

> But for an administration that seemed to have a deep understanding of the internet, the site was shockingly bad. How could the Obama administration, the brains behind the most sophisticated online political campaign ever, be responsible for something so bone-headed?

It’s worth nothing that, while the Obama campaign’s crew was made of tech-savvy staff using bleeding-edge tools and techniques, Healthcare.gov was awarded as a contract to a large company which outsourced various parts of the project. The nearly $100 million project went to the lowest bidder, suffered from standard bureaucratic compliance issues, and was built in a closed process without the benefit of public critique. It’s the basic recipe for enterprise software disaster.

But I think most people looking at this are missing another important difference between the Obama campaign and Obamacare: **passion**. The people who were both employed by and volunteered for the Obama campaign were passionate members of the team. They weren’t just contract hires; they believed in what Obama stood for and were determined to leverage their skills to toward his victory.

The truth is that Obama was never a tech-savvy politician. He was just the politician that, for various reasons, resonated with tech-savvy people. As a president, [he hasn’t displayed a great deal of personal tech-savvy](http://imgur.com/gCC2ai2). He’s played the Washington game just like any other politician. [Obamacare’s IT is just like any Federal IT project](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/why-us-government-it-fails-so-hard-so-often/). He was never about changing government for the better or innovating toward a bright new future—that’s what his hacker supporters were about, and he played them. Now they’re out in the cold, watching as the man they backed doubles-down on domestic spying and [cronyism](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml).

[I still doubt](/techies-dont-love-republicans/) that Republicans have much chance of wooing the tech elite. But I hope that talented techies will look at the Obama administration, their abuses and their boondoggles, and at least come to the conclusion that Democrats don’t represent their interests either. No politicians do.

If technology is really going to improve our nation and our world, it will be done by the hands of free people and not politicians or bureaucrats.
