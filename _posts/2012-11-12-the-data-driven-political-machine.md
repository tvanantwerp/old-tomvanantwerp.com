As Obama has proved twice, successful campaigns are increasingly dependent on data: where it’s from, how well it’s crunched, and whether or not you can leverage it. Utilizing data better than the other guy is essential in a digital world where elections are decided at the margin.

## Whales in a Sea of Data

[Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney with a vastly superior data mining operation.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/10/1160145/-How-Romney-s-ORCA-was-defeated-by-Obama-s-Narwhal-Dreamcatcher) The Obama team’s [Narwhal and Dreamcatcher](http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/) projects should be considered [textbook examples of what to do with big data](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-lessons-from-obamas-ad-campaign-2012-11). Since 2008, they quintupled their data mining operation. Disparate databases were integrated and used to drive diverse campaign decisions. Fundraising strategies, get-out-the-vote efforts, the when and where of ad buys—everything was targeted, everything was tested.

Compare to Romney’s [Project Orca](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83653.html), which I’ve only seen described as an [unmitigated disaster](http://ace.mu.nu/archives/334783.php). This get-out-the-vote system was launched late in the game, people weren’t trained to use it, it wasn’t properly tested, and it may have done more to frustrate Republican voters than enable them to vote. It’s the antithesis of Obama’s data driven campaign. And it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the Republicans messed this up so badly. When you drive away all the young people by embracing intolerant social conservatism, [you’re left with crazy people who understand technology rather poorly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLoqti0lzAw&feature=g-hist). In the end, Romney’s billionaire backers were no match for Obama’s tech-savvy staff.

## Lessons for Libertarians

When it comes to utilizing data, libertarians just as behind as Republicans. Very little is being done to collect, analyze and utilize data about people sympathetic to the libertarian perspective. What little I’ve heard about supposedly libertarian data gathering projects like [Themis](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-usa-politics-kochs-idUSBRE84G0E820120517) makes me think they are nowhere near the level of Narwhal and Dreamcatcher. In my limited experience, most libertarian organizations use data more like Orca than Narwhal. What data does exist is often siloed internally and never shared with external partners. This lack of technological infrastructure persists despite disproportionate numbers of young people attracted to libertarian ideas.

The decades-long libertarian focus on academia and think tanks is partly to blame. A generations of libertarians came of age writing white papers and op-eds, with few mechanisms in place to measure their impact. This strategy may have marginally slowed down big government, but it hasn’t halted it. And though the Internet has connected a growing libertarian base, many activist libertarians are either economics nerds or [Paultards](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Paultard) burying gold in their backyards. It seems like every bright young college student who discovers libertarianism wants to write policy papers for a living! (Or worse, they want to reform the GOP!)

I don’t know any libertarians building data mining infrastructure on the level of the Obama campaign’s. It’s going to be a huge and continuing disadvantage, whether libertarians want to promote political candidates or simply message ideas more effectively.

The libertarian movement needs less economists and more computer programmers.
