I just finished reading [a selection of passages](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/04/29/collected-quotations-of-the-dread-pirate-roberts-founder-of-the-drug-site-silk-road-and-radical-libertarian/) written by a man known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts, founder of the anonymous Amazon-for-narcotics website [Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)). I hadn’t previously realized that this site was founded by someone so explicitly libertarian (or agorist, anarcho-capitalist, whatever, close enough). It’s a fascinating read, and self-recommending.

Many non-libertarians won’t be able to appreciate the intellectual tradition of his writing. Because I’ve read up on [libertarian history](http://www.amazon.com/Radicals-Capitalism-Freewheeling-American-Libertarian/dp/1586485725/), and because I’m part of the class of libertarian “professionals” working to preserve and expand liberty, it’s more obvious to me where his influences lie. I’ll try my best to describe these views a bit, give some thoughts of my own, and go into some detail on their origins. Having not existed for most of libertarian history, and being involved in libertarianism for only a few years, forgive me if my retelling of characters and events is in error. Corrections welcome.

Dread Pirate Robert’s views are a mix of [Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard#Anarcho-capitalism), which is what you usually see pushed by [Lew Rockwell](http://www.lewrockwell.com/) and the [Mises Institute](http://mises.org/), and Samuel Edward Konkin III’s [agorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism). His views on environmentalism, child labor, minimum wage, and many other traditionally “left” issues are the typical and disappointing market utopianism arguments that I’m accustomed to seeing.

For example, on environmentalism:

> Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism. As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise. Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it. Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it. People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital. Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalist’s dream.

And on child labor:

> If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse. That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves. Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.

If you’re not already a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian, you probably won’t be readily convinced by anything he has to say on these topics. It’s a simplistic assumption that market mechanisms must, in time, make all circumstances good and better. But I think it often overlooks the actual problems that many non-libertarians have with these situations. Environmentalists don’t so much care that high prices of resources connected to greater scarcity will encourage less consumption; they want those resources to not become more scarce to begin with. Advocates against child labor aren’t wanting children to starve rather than work; they want children to have a third option superior to starvation or wage slavery. I won’t argue whether these libertarian views are correct or not. But I will call them out for being theoretical at the expense of practical, logical at the expense of empathetic, and more likely to make enemies than win friends when framed this way.

My views on the above arguments tie into my general impression of Murray Rothbard and his biggest present day cheerleader, Lew Rockwell. I personally think Rockwell is an awful troll, and that his association with the libertarian brand has done it as much harm as good. He is, after all, [the prime suspect](http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter) behind the authorship of the racist Ron Paul newsletters. It was one embarassing and inexcusable part of a strategy created by Rothbard and Rockwell to spread libertarianism to a new right-wing audience.

> The newsletters’ obsession with blacks and gays was of a piece with a conscious political strategy adopted at that same time by Lew Rockwell and Murray Rothbard. After breaking with the Libertarian Party following the 1988 presidential election, Rockwell and Rothbard formed a schismatic “paleolibertarian” movement, which rejected what they saw as the social libertinism and leftist tendencies of mainstream libertarians. In 1990, they launched the *Rothbard-Rockwell Report*, where they crafted a plan they hoped would midwife a broad new “paleo” coalition.

Their plan, as distasteful as I personally find it, has worked. Through associating with Ron Paul, many people have been exposed to libertarian ideas—self included. The libertarian brand grew, but it was also tarnished by those more despicable elements of social conservatism and outright racism that came with pandering almost exclusively to right-wingers. It’s why, despite first learning about libertarianism through Ron Paul’s campaigns, I don’t involve myself with Paul family politics.

It makes sense, to an extent, why Rothbard and Rockwell find libertarian libertinism distasteful: they thought it wouldn’t sell. Unfortunately, they had too little faith in the power of their own ideas, as the US has continued to show growing support for gay rights, drug legalization, and a host of other, more leftist, libertarian concerns. Meanwhile, free market economics continues to be tied to backwards social conservatism in the minds of many, and we have people like Rothbard and Rockwell to thank for that.

Here is where we see the greater influence of Konkin rather than Rothbard on DPR’s political philosophy. Using cryptography to create a massive anonymous drug trade in cyberspace is the very definition of Konkin’s counter-economic strategy, and something that would have left Rothbard and Rockwell aghast. Konkin believed that acting outside of the scope of state sanction would weaken the state and erode it’s base of resources. In this [New Libertarian Manifesto](http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/nlm/nlm1.html), he wrote:

> Every victim of statism has internalized the State to some degree. The IRS’s annual proclamation that the income tax depends on “voluntary compliance” is ironically true. Should the taxpayers completely cut off the blood supply, the vampire State would helplessly perish, its unpaid police and army deserting almost immediately, defanging the Monster. If everyone abandoned “legal tender” for gold and goods in contracts and other exchanges, it is doubtful that even taxation could sustain the modern State.

I don’t know nearly as much about Konkin as I do Rothbard or Rockwell. While his influence is known and noted in the annuals of libertarian thought, he’s a relatively minor figure with a smaller legacy. He is most known as the father of agorism, which no normal person has ever heard of or would care about. He was a fan of science fiction, and certainly knew Murray Rothbard. The libertarian movement was so small at one point, that it was expected that everybody knew everybody, whether you agreed with them or not. Konkin saw more opportunity for co-opting the left rather than the right, as Rothbard and Rockwell attempted with mixed success. Their differences aside, at least they all hated the “Kochtopus”.

Dread Pirate Roberts cites Konkin as his primary influence and inspiration. He described his personal revelation after reading J. Neil Schulman’s Konkin-inspired novel [Alongside Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alongside_Night):

> At last the missing puzzle piece! All of the sudden it was so clear: every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state. I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn’t have it’s tax revenues. No soldiers if you can’t pay them. No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.

And so we can see Dread Pirate Roberts not as a mere drug lord. He does not, as Konkin observed of most black marketeers, “wish to ‘make [his] bundle’ and return to the ‘straight society.'” DPR does what he does not only for money, but for a cause. And his cause is to Starve the Beast.

Now we can begin to see the Silk Road not just as some newfangled place that kids buy their drugs these days. It’s a conscious effort to undermine government power. Dread Pirate Roberts is no armchair theorist, nor a petty drug slinger. He’s a man on a mission. And his mission is to end the state.

Silk Road in DPR’s own words (emphasis mine, abuse of caps lock his):

> Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started. It could literally change the world as we know it. It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there. **Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?** Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed? …
>
> As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision. Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success. In that world, Silk Road will be a shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy. **Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this**. We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.

> **Update**: [Ross Ulbricht, a man whom the FBI claims is the Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested in the first week of October, 2013](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/dread-pirate-roberts-arrested/). Among the allegations are charges that he attempted to hire hitmen to torture and kill thieves and extortionists. I do not condone assassination, and, if Ulbricht is DPR and did as the complaints claim, then **he has lost all credibility as a potential libertarian hero**.
