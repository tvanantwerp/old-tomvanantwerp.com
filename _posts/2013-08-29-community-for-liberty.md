Just today, I came upon a portmanteau that precisely describes an idea I’ve been obsessed with, but had difficulty articulating: [scenius](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php). It’s a combination of “scene” and “genius”, and it describes how multiple individuals acting through a supportive network can accomplish great things. Think of the hackers of Silicon Valley, or the salon-goers of the Enlightenment.

> Scenius is like genius, only embedded in a scene rather than in genes. … Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire you.

As someone who wants to change the world by bringing more freedom to more people, I’m deeply interested in how to create libertarian scenius. I know many libertarians whom I might qualify as individual geniuses, but their real-world impact is usually small due to the missing multiplier effect found in scenius. I don’t think libertarian scenius currently exists, so it’s worth understanding how to nurture it for maximum world-changing effect.

In [a previous blog post](/tear-my-ideas-apart/) where I discussed project ideas I’d like to work on, the last two—firstly a libertarian “hackerspace”, secondly an actual libertarian living complex—were both trying to encourage scenius among libertarians in Washington, DC. If it’s going to happen anywhere, I believe it’s here. Not because DC is some wonderful libertarian utopia; it obviously isn’t. But it could happen in DC because so many bright young libertarians move here in hopes of making a difference.

But with so many libertarians already in DC, and more moving in all the time, why isn’t there libertarian scenius here already? I think the article give an important insight:

> When it pops up, don’t crush it. When it starts rolling, don’t formalize it. When it sparks, fan it. But don’t move the scenius to better quarters. Try to keep accountants and architects and police and do-gooders away from it. Let it remain inefficient, wasteful, edgy, marginal, in the basement, downtown, in the ‘burbs, in the hotel ballroom, on the fringes, out back, in Camp 4.

This is the exact opposite path libertarians have taken. Our nonprofits are formalized and often unwilling to let spontaneous order flourish—despite the fact that we of all people should know better. We work in downtown DC offices, dressing respectably and writing policy studies. Because, uh, that’s what grown-ups do? I swear, we would all be outstanding bureaucrats.

I’ve constantly had trouble justifying my ideas for building a broader libertarian community. Whether that means peer learning, a libertarian apartment complex, or outreach to designers or hackers or whoever, I usually get the same lukewarm response: “OK, you bring these people together, and then what?”

I’ve never had an answer to that. But I’m thinking more and more, why should I need an answer to that? Libertarianism is about embracing [spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order), social experimentation and the unpredictable but often amazing outcomes of voluntary association. If we really stand for these ideas, then creating a diverse libertarian community for mutual support has obvious value in and of itself. The precise outcomes of scenius are *ex ante* unknowable; but we have example after example of such spontaneous orders creating massive gains, whether within a field or for humanity as a whole.

I don’t want to downplay the contribution of great minds. Notable individuals have shaped libertarianism today, and continue to do so. There are many specific individuals whom I believe have been critical to keeping the libertarian movement alive, and I respect them. My goal is to challenge them, and other libertarians, to examine their own methods. We must all ask ourselves whether we couldn’t be doing more by harnessing the power of organic communities rather than emulating top-down bureaucracies.
