Of all the things I read online, some things are good enough to recommend more thoroughly than via tweet. I’ve decided to start sharing a few selections of things I’ve been reading on a regular basis. This week: Japanese business culture, how Reddit’s front page works, fitting in as a black woman in tech, Cantonese proverbs illustrated, and tracking your coworkers whereabouts (if you really wanted to).

* [Doing Business in Japan](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/) by [Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com/about/)
This is a very interesting look at living and working in Japan. The continued existence of salaryman culture in a hyper-competitive global economy seems like a bizarre anachronism. Japanese megacorps demand insane levels of commitment, both in terms of hours worked and long-term loyalty to the company. But they offer a sort of benevolent paternalism in exchange, giving employees social status and ensuring they are provided with all the basics of life while mitigating against personal risk. It’s like private-sector communism: give all of yourself for the good of CollectiveCorp, and CollectiveCorp will take care of you. Not my cup of sencha, but I guess it works well for some.
* [The reddit Front Page is Not a Meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/) by [Todd W. Schneider](http://toddwschneider.com/about/)
This post takes a thorough look at what makes the front page of Reddit and what doesn’t. As many on Hacker News commented, he could’ve just looked at Reddit’s source code to know that the algorithms have bias. But I was very impressed by the research methodology, which could certainly be applied to sites where the code isn’t available for review. If you browse Reddit at all, check out this post to see what ends up on the front page and what doesn’t. You may be surprised.
* [The Other Side of Diversity](https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e) by [EricaJoy](https://medium.com/@ericajoy)
As a white male, I don’t often feel discriminated against or pressured to conform to a certain way of living that is not my own. It’s easy to forget sometimes that racism, both actual and unintended, is still prevalent in society—even in communities that mythologize pure meritocracy and denounce all manner of -isms. Reading this piece made me feel ill as I imagined the author’s pain from living a faked life and facing constant unwarranted judgement. If you’re as undeservedly privileged as I am, this is worth a read.
* [Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture](http://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/) by [Ah To](https://www.facebook.com/Artohk)
This one isn’t so much a thing I read as it is a thing I looked at. My wife is from Hong Kong, and I love learning new Cantonese phrases from her. So I loved this illustration the moment I saw it: 81 different Cantonese proverbs, all in one giant illustration. It probably won’t make a lot of sense to Westerners on its own, but it is thankfully annotated. Take a look at this playful celebration of Cantonese language and culture.
* [How to track your coworkers](http://willschenk.com/how-to-track-your-coworkers) by [Will Schenk](http://willschenk.com/bio)
First a disclaimer: I don’t track my coworkers, nor do I care to. But this is a cool tutorial on how you could see if coworkers are in the office or not based on whether or not their cell phones are connected to the office WiFi. I actually track similar data for myself using IFTTT to log WiFi connections/disconnections in Google Docs. I haven’t thought of a use for that data yet, but it will be there when I do. As for seeing if my coworkers are in or not, I still do this the old-fashioned way: I get up and walk to their offices and see if they are inside.
