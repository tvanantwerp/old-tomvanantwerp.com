Do you give to nonprofits? If so, do you judge them based on how low they can keep overhead expenses compared to programs?

[**Stop it.**](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong.html)

You want to believe that the lion’s share of your donation is going directly to the cause. I get that. But you’re really just preventing the nonprofit from being successful. And I should know; I work at a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and I am overhead.

The truth about nonprofits is that they are businesses. Nonprofits have employees. Nonprofits need to make payroll. Nonprofits need to invest in capital so their employees can work effectively. Nonprofits need to pay for accounting services, legal services, and everything else that keeps the cogs spinning.

Do you want to see your favorite nonprofits grow? Do you want to see them become wildly successful and accomplish their mission? Well, sometimes that means large overhead expenses. By pressuring nonprofits to keep a low overhead-to-programs expense ratio, you’re forcing them to stay small and ineffective. You’re sending the soldiers of social change onto the battlefield without bullets, hoping they’ll win the war purely with good intentions.

When you give your money to a business for their product or service, you don’t care what percent goes to their overhead as long as they deliver. It’s the same with nonprofits. Stop worrying about their internal cost structure, and start looking at their results. This is harder to measure for nonprofits than businesses, but it’s not impossible.

Don’t demand the wrong metrics just because they’re easier to measure. Nobody thinks the man who looks for his keys under the light post—because that’s the only place where he can see—is wise. You may not know exactly what to look for in a successful nonprofit, and that’s OK. But it doesn’t mean you measure them by what’s visible, simply because it’s easy. If you’re not willing to take the time to find out if the nonprofit is really accomplishing it’s mission, why give in the first place?

If you care about the mission of the nonprofits you support, let them figure out the best use for their funds. It’s possible that they won’t spend the funds wisely. That might happen. But it’s also possible that they’ll leverage those funds to achieve greater success than could have ever been possible otherwise. It’s an investment, and it carries risk. That’s something you need to be comfortable with if you really want to make a difference through nonprofits.

But if you’re dead-set against giving to nonprofits with high overhead expenses, and nothing I’ve said has swayed you, then feel free to go buy yourself a box of Girl Scout cookies. Nothing keeps overhead low like unpaid child labor.
