Unrest in the Ukraine and Venezuela has a lot of my friends excited. As libertarians, they’re not fond of the repressive Venezuelan regime nor the cronyist Ukrainian government. And they’re right that these are bad governments to live under. Popular uprisings against these governments are, for my friends, reasons for optimism.

In case the title didn’t give it away already, I disagree.

Violent revolution is, by the numbers, a terrible way to expand human liberty. While we Americans often look fondly on the idea—it was, after all, revolution that created our relatively free country—an objective analysis paints a very different picture.

Let’s start with that beloved American Revolution. It started with such wonderful popular protests as [tarring and feathering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFWZ925zK0A), and ended with a war that lead to deaths on all sides numbering in the [tens of thousands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War#Casualties). Oh, and did I mention that it was still OK to own people? Yeah, kind of a big oversight for a revolution aimed at more freedom. And after nearly a century, half of America revolted again to *defend* that insanity. [That cost another million lives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War#Costs). All of this from the country that supposedly did revolution correctly!

Ignoring that a great many revolutions lean more toward communism than libertarianism, let’s take a look at another revolution begun in the liberal spirit: the French Revolution. In a lot of ways, [The Declaration of the Rights of Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_the_Citizen) is even better than the Declaration of Independence. It’s hard to get more libertarian than this:

> La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à autrui : ainsi, l’exercice des droits naturels de chaque homme n’a de bornes que celles qui assurent aux autres Membres de la Société la jouissance de ces mêmes droits.
>
> [Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights.]

And yet, such a classically liberal revolution ended with the [Reign of Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) and the rise of Napoleon, plunging the European continent into [wars that killed millions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars).

But these revolutions are quite tame in historical context. To really get a grasp of what a bloody rebellion can accomplish, take a look at [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll).

| Rebellion | Estimated Death Toll | Est. % of the World Population Killed |
|:--- | --- | --- |
| Late Yuan warfare and transition to Ming Dynasty | 30,000,000 | 6.70% |
| Qing dynasty conquest of the Ming Dynasty | 25,000,000 | 4.80% |
| Taiping Rebellion ([led by a guy who said he was Jesus’s brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan)) | 20,000,000-100,000,000 | 1.6%–8% |
| An Lushan Rebellion | 13,000,000-36,000,000 | 5.5%–15.3% |
| Dungan revolt | 8,000,000-12,000,000 | 0.6%–0.9% |
| Yellow Turban Rebellion | 3,000,000-7,000,000 | 1.3%–3.1% |
| Du Wenxiu Rebellion | 800,000-1,000,000 |  ? |

You want to know why Deng Xiaopeng so brutally put down demonstrations at Tiananmen Square? Because he could count. Revolutions in China go very, very badly. Doesn’t make him right, but it does put things in context.

And that’s the context I’d like my fellow libertarians to consider when watching events unfold in Venezuela and Ukraine: revolutions kill lots of people, and usually without any significant gains in human freedom. I’ll readily acknowledge how terrible their current governments are, but I seriously doubt the power of mass bloodshed to improve the situation.
