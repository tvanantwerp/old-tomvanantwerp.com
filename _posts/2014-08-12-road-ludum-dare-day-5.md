Ludum Dare preparation continues. Today I practiced some of the 2D stuff I learned yesterday and created a very basic demo of a guy who can run around. Nothing super fancy here. However, getting this much to work makes it a lot easier to assemble these parts and pieces for an entire game. Most of tonight’s work is based on [this video](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d/2d-controllers). For anyone who is interested, [I’m putting all of my files on GitHub](https://github.com/tvanantwerp/unity3d-tutorials).

Making progress!
