Inspired by a coworker who told me of her love of kale chips—and the time she pounded on the doors of a closed Trader Joe’s in a desperate plea to buy some kale—I decided I would try it myself. So for the first time in my life, I bought a bag of washed and cut kale on the way home. I even sprung for the organic kale at a $0.30 premium.

We can all guess what happened next.

I got a recipe, and followed it precisely. When the chips were done baking, I pulled them out. They were…a bit brown. And in spots, quite a bit black. Did I cook it too long? I tried one, and the first sensation was that of sharp edges defiantly poking the inside of my mouth. The next sensation was the taste, which in hindsight should have been entirely predictable: burned leaf flavor.

The totality of my failure was all at once apparent. Worse, I knew my wife Valerie would be home soon. In an effort to avoid harsh judgment, I knew what I had to do.

Quickly, I began disposing of the evidence. “Chip” after “chip”, I ate the burned leaves I’d so enthusiastically made. No time to savor, were it even possible. Chew, feel miserable, swallow, repeat until it’s all gone.

Punishment for hubris endured, I disposed of the greasy foil sheet and acted as if nothing had happened. Perhaps, I speculated, I would get away with it!

The first thing Valerie says to me upon entering our apartment:

“Something smells good; what did you cook?”
