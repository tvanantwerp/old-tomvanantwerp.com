[Bryan Caplan](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/07/statism_for_fre.html) asks of many [libertarians](/libertarianism-must-die/):

> Libertarians’ [odd openness](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/07/boudreaux_and_t.html) to using immigration restrictions to protect American freedom has me thinking.  There are many statist policies that could indirectly lead to more libertarian policy. … Out of all the conceivable forms of statism for freedom, why oh why are immigration restrictions the exception you’re swiftest to condone?

The first comment asks back, “Do you really need it spelled out?” And no, I doubt he does. But let’s do it anyway, because I despise confronting evil with innuendo when clearer words will do.

**A lot of libertarians are racist. They oppose immigration because they are bigoted.**

These libertarians will not admit this. They have plausible-sounding reasons to want restrictions on immigration. But these reasons are rather weak, and easily overcome.

One common claim is that increased legal immigration would put a larger burden on the welfare state, thus growing Leviathan. It is a stupid argument. Regular ole’ human reproduction can do that just as well, but I don’t hear these libertarians calling for mass sterilization.

Others claim that immigrants come from less libertarian countries, and they will make America’s voting population less libertarian. This too is nonsense. A great many people immigrate to America because it is *more* libertarian than the country they are leaving. My own wife, an immigrant, is regularly disgusted with American government and society for being *too much like* Communist China.

I will concede that many immigrants tend to vote for Democrats over Republicans, but is that any surprise when the Republican Party is the one screaming that they want to deport them all *en masse*? Besides, any libertarian who still believes Republicans are any less statist than Democrats must have been in a coma between the years 2000 and 2008. From my own experience dealing with US immigration policy, I can tell you that immigrants should be more amenable to libertarianism than most other people. The fact that they aren’t is not their fault, but ours.

I contend that there is no *good* reason that a libertarian would want to restrict immigration. But there is one very *bad* reason, as I mentioned earlier. A great many libertarians really are racists. When you’ve eliminated every other reason, what else is there? Sugar coat it any way you want, deny it as loudly as you wish; if you oppose freer immigration, it’s the racist position and you’re being a racist by holding it.

Yet again, my definition of libertarianism seems at odds with what a lot of self-styled libertarians believe in. I can’t reconcile the concept of a personal racism with political libertarianism. I see no way to advocate for liberty while also harboring a hate for blacks, Hispanics, or any race not your own. Because if you really do look down on other races, you can’t really believe in *liberty for all*. To think or act as a racist make you a *de facto* non-libertarian.

And if those of us libertarians who are *not* hateful bigots don’t publicly denounce the people who act as such, it’s our own fault when we’re mistaken for them.

We must call out racism when we see it. Lot’s of Ron Paul fans loathed Reason Magazine for pointing out the racist Ron Paul newsletters, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. Whenever a supposedly libertarian person advocates racism, such as in the form of immigration restrictions, they need to be publicly shamed for it. Otherwise our silence becomes assent, and we are likewise branded by their racism.

Libertarians have a responsibility to stand up for the disenfranchised, for immigrants and minorities. These are the people hurt most by governments, and those who have the most to gain from freedom. If these people turn to more and stronger government, it is only because we have not reached out to them as friends and allies.

For a more genuinely libertarian attitude toward immigrants, I leave you with this:

> Give me your tired, your poor,
> Your huddled masses, yearning to breath free,
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,
> Send these, the homeless, tempest tost to me,
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door.
