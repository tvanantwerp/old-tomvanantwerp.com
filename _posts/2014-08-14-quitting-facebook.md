I remember when I first heard of Facebook near the end of high school. Skeptical that it was another MySpace, full of morons who abused HTML, I resisted it. But soon I gave it a try and discovered that it was actually pretty useful. It was great for keeping track of the many friends I met at college, and I eventually accepted Facebook as a normal part of life.

But that feeling that Facebook was useful—that it somehow helped me stay in touch—has been slowly eroding. I’ve considered leaving several times before, but never made up my mind to do it. No matter how many times I reflexively visited Facebook, saw nothing of interest and communicated with no one, closed the tab, and repeated five minutes later, I still thought it had value. I’d made so many friends around the world, and wasn’t sure how I could hope to keep in touch without Facebook.

Then one day, I thought, does Facebook really provide me the tools to stay in touch with friends? What if my only reason for holding on is bunk? I had to know, so I started checking my metadata.

In the past three months, I’ve spend 30 hours and 9 minutes on Facebook. During all of that time, I messaged—or was messaged by—17 different individuals. Of those individuals, only two are A) people I never see and don’t live near and B) people I want to stay in touch with. *I’ve kept in touch with only two people in three months.*

That’s only Messenger. What about interactions through posts and comments? Well, in the past month I shared 103 statues updates and links. The median number of likes and comments for each? *Just one*.

So it’s not just my imagination. Facebook really isn’t useful for staying in touch with my friends. Every time I visit Facebook, I see largely the same thing that I myself put out: signaling. I signal with my shares that I like liberty and technology and design. My friends signal what it is they like. None of us are really talking to anyone in particular–we’re just putting this noise out there. It’s as much of a meaningful conversation as a male peacock’s tail feathers. I’ve been wasting 10 hours per month on posturing, both yours and mine.

Seeing the numbers, I can finally make the decision to leave Facebook and feel good about it.

I’m not going nuclear and deleting my account—I may still need Facebook in the future for other reasons, such as managing pages for groups or organizations I’m affiliated with or checking event invitations. But I won’t be reading the news feed anymore—those few important notifications will go to email, and I’ll stop checking Facebook itself. The day may come when I become active on Facebook again, but I don’t know when that would be or what would prompt me to do it.

When I was in Hong Kong this past February, I loved the disconnect from the 24-hour news cycle and [checking Facebook made me ill](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/ten-days-hong-kong/). I’m looking forward to that liberated feeling again.

This will be my last share on Facebook.
