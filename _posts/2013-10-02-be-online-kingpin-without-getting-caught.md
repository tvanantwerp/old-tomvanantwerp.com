If you haven’t read the criminal complaint against Ross Ulbricht, alleged owner of the Silk Road, [do it now](http://www.scribd.com/doc/172764080/Ulbricht-Criminal-Complaint). Not only is it an entertaining real-world Breaking Bad story, but it’s also a how-not-to-do when you’re trying to stay anonymous online. I’d like to take a moment and outline many of the stupid things that Ulbricht did which, according to this complaint, got him caught.

## Reused Aliases and Tied them to Actual Identity

The first known posts which are believed to originate from Ulbricht are under the username “altoid”. With this name, Ulbricht allegedly tried to drum up interest in the Silk Road in two online forums: shroomery.org and bitcointalk.org. Eight months later, “altoid” made another post on bitcointalk.org seeking help for a bitcoin-related online venture. To whom should interested parties apply? To rossulbricht@gmail.com, naturally. And, of course, that email takes you to [his public Google+ profile](https://plus.google.com/101844174649242995101/posts) full of pictures of himself. Ulbricht also openly solicited advice on stackoverflow.com on how to use PHP with Tor hidden services, and code similar to that which he was using became part of the Silk Road.

A clever person would never have reused identities. There are services that allow one to [create temporary email addresses](http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html) and generate names. They are simple and easy to throw away. *And at no point should anything be tied to your real name*.

## Didn't Change His Basic Behavior while Using Alter Ego

[Dread Pirate Roberts is a known anarcho-capitalist](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/the-political-philosophy-of-a-crypto-kingpin/) influenced by Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard by way of the [Mises Institute](http://mises.org/). That doesn’t mean anything to normal people, and that’s why it’s a very distinguishing feature. According to Ross Ulbricht’s public Google+ and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht) pages (and [his Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rossulbricht/about) if you can see it), he’s clearly a Mises Institute fan. It’s not hard to say, “Oh, this Ross Ulbricht guy loves Mises, and so does DPR, and Ulbricht seems to have been promoting the Silk Road around the time it was founded.” You don’t even need to use state surveillance to figure this one out.

If you want to be anonymous, you need to disrupt your profile. If you blather on about Austrian economics in your real life, then, once you’re wearing your mask, maybe chat about Keynesian economics or kittens or the Milky Way’s pending collision with the Andromeda galaxy in a few million years. Whatever, just don’t make it obvious that the real you and the alter ego enjoy the same things and hold the same opinions.

## Didn't Move Around Enough

Ulbricht was too confident in the power of Tor and VPNs to hide the origin of his Internet connections. The FBI didn’t have a hard time tracing DPR’s IP address from the Silk Road to a small area of San Francisco where Ulbricht lived. If the complaint is to be believed, they even used real subpoenas to get the info!

Just like you need to mix up your behavior pattern, you need to mix up your geographic pattern. This is partly what Tor is for, but it doesn’t work in a world of dragnet surveillance. Admittedly, varying your physical location is costly, difficult, and typically generates a unique profile of its own. Seeing that DPR is logging in from the place Ulbricht lives is just as damning as seeing that Ulbricht buys coffee with his debit card at Starbucks’ across the nation at the same time DPR logs in to the wi-fi at those same Starbucks.

This problem is hard, and I don’t yet have a good answer. But if I had basic advice for doing this, it would be to wear gloves, pay for everything in cash, don’t carry a phone, don’t drive your own car or take a form of transit that requires ID. Maybe buy prepaid credit cards with cash, buy Megabus tickets with those, and ride the Megabus in disguise. Whatever you do, consider Ulbricht’s approach lazy.

## He Hard-Coded Silk Road Admin Access to Only Permit His Own IP Address, and Left the Code Publicly Available

I can’t even begin to fathom how he thought this was a good idea. It’s beyond belief. It’s like if the Unabomber had affixed return address labels to his bombs. My only advice here is not to be a total moron.

## He Mailed Himself Fake IDs with His Picture on Them

Again, this is all kinds of stupid. I can’t imagine why anyone would think this is a good idea. (Then again, the whole concept of Silk Road is to mail illegal drugs to your own home, so…)

I don’t know anything about fake IDs. But I know how people treat me and my real ID. As long as the gender and skin color match, you’re probably good. Maybe don’t use exactly your photo. Or exactly your birth date. And don’t mail illegal goods to your own home. And if you really need a good fake ID, you had better learn to make that stuff yourself. [The Feds are all over that trade](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/open-market/).

## He Freely Volunteered that People Could Use Tor and Silk Road to Anonymously Buy Contraband

When police confronted him about the fake IDs in his San Francisco apartment, Ulbricht didn’t admit anything but did talk about things that, clearly, DPR would have an interest in. This both violates the earlier rule that your alter egos are, in fact, alter egos, and the generally good advice to [never speak to police without counsel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc).

## Conclusion

Any one of these mistakes would have been enough to suggest, at least in a small way, that Ulbricht is Dread Pirate Roberts. Taken together, they practically scream it. [Most of these mistakes could’ve been avoided](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/feds-take-down-online-fraud-bazaar-silk-road-arrest-alleged-mastermind/#more-22887), or at least predicted. I obviously don’t encourage you to play Breaking Bad in real life like Ulbricht may have. But if you’re a political dissident or merely very private, then learn from DPR’s mistakes.

> Note: I do not condone many of the actions allegedly taken by Ulbricht. Murder is clearly wrong, and there appear to be at least two instances where [Ulbricht tried to have someone assassinated](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feds-silkroad-boss-paid-80000-for-snitchs-murder-and-torture/). Much like the story of Breaking Bad, wherein the protagonist begins along a path of crime with the noblest intentions and ideals, Ulbricht seems to have gone from would-be libertarian revolutionary to greedy, violent drug lord. Should the allegations prove true, then I have no sympathy for Ulbricht and hope that justice is served accordingly.
