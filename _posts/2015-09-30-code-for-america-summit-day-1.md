As I write this, I'm attending the [Code for America Summit][cfasummit] in Oakland, CA. It's my first time here (both at this conference and in California), and so far I'm having a blast! It's easily one of the best-run conferences I've been to. And I'm in love with the enthusiasm of so many of the people here who are willing to do very technical work to make the lives of average citizens easier.

Long-time readers of my blog know that I'm a very [libertarian][1] person. I'm quite sure that most of the attendees here are not libertarian. Reducing the size and scope of government is not on their agenda. Many libertarians would feel ill-at-ease here. But I'm inspired. Speaking with people here, I feel that, whatever political difference we might have, we're really working toward the same things. I'm among friends. My honest belief is that all of these people--many of them proclaimed progessives--are doing more to reduce the burden of bad government for citizens than nearly every libertarian organization I've ever seen.

Government is often monolithic. I think of the film [*Brazil*][2], which is the most frightening depiction of dystopian government I've ever seen: an uncaring and unaccountable bureaucracy that ruins lives through mere clerical error. But Code for America and the people who associate with it are doing awesome things to transform governments, one agency at a time, from *Brazil*-style nightmares into genuinely responsive and helpful services.

I'll talk more about specific services, concepts, and tools that I've discovered here in later posts. But right now, I just want to comment on how inspired I am by this citizen-driven effort to make government, if not smaller, at least much less crappy. I may not agree with everyone at this conference about what government policy should be, but I think we largely agree on how it could best be implemented to improve lives rather than disrupt them. Many libertarians I know are content to say "government should just not be involved" and leave it at that; the people I'm meeting here are rightly more focused on transforming existing government involvement into something genuinely useful.
