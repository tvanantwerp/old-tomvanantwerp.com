The premise of [*The Martian*](http://amzn.to/1h2hnNl) is that astronaut Mark Watney is accidentally stranded on the surface of Mars. He doesn't have enough food or water or anything else to survive for long, and is forced to become MacGuyer to stay alive.

The story **of** *The Martian* is, in some ways, more incredible than the story **in** *The Martian*. Andy Weir wrote and published this book online as a series of free-to-read posts. Responding to his readers who didn't like reading books on a PC, he created a Kindle version and set the price to the minimum allowed. As sales grew and grew, his book became increasingly popular and is now being made into [a movie starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8). It's an awesome tale of self-publishing success.

*The Martian* is a fun read, but the true origin diminishes the quality of the book. Much of the writing is in the form of Mark Watney's log entries from the Martian surface. I don't know what an astronaut stranded on Mars would actually say in his logs, but I want to believe that they won't sound like blog posts. Watney accomplishes many "firsts" during his life on Mars, including being its first blogger. I love the premise, and the overall narrative is solid; but the writing shows signs of its online serialization that detract from the experience.

It doesn't help that Mark Watney's log entries read like the blog of any young Silicon Valley coder.

I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but not *that* hyperbolic. I don't know if I find Watney's tone unbelievable, or that I just don't want to believe anyone who writes like that might one day go to Mars.

Don't think I didn't enjoy the book--I did. It's a fun adventure, and there were definitely parts where I couldn't stop reading. It's very fascinating to think of all the actual challenges a man would face on Mars. I also recently read this very long piece on [Elon Musk's long-term plans to colonize Mars](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html); between that and *The Martian*, I've been seriously nerding out. If you think space travel--actual space travel, not "our technology is so advanced it's indistinguishable from magic" science fiction--is cool, then you should read [*The Martian*](http://amzn.to/1h2hnNl).

Just try to get over the fact that astronaut Mark Watney talks like a [brogrammer](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brogrammer).
