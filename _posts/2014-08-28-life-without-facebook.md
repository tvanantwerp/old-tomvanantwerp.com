I gave up using Facebook two weeks ago. After crunching the numbers and discovering that [I wasn’t engaging with friends in the way I thought I was](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/quitting-facebook/), it seemed like an easy way to get back ten hours of my life each month. And in that respect, it’s been a success. I’ve missed very little of the things that get shared through the Facebook news feed. Those few items of actual personal interest seem to find their way to me regardless, and I’m less distracted by trivia.

But leaving Facebook has had one side effect I didn’t anticipate: I’m stuck with my thoughts.

I hadn’t appreciated the psychological release that Facebook provided for dealing with randomly occurring thoughts. Musings, entertaining circumstances, jokes, cool articles, pictures of interesting things—I used to send them off to my Facebook feed without hesitation. It was like a mental pressure release valve. I could throw any idea against the wall and see what stuck.

I can still do this with Twitter. But because I’m mostly followed by strangers, I don’t expect them to care about anything not directly related to the reason they followed me. It’s not quite the same.

Now, when I have a sudden thought which I would have otherwise shared, I’m stuck with it. There’s nothing I can do except experience it, and then let it go. I was alive before Facebook, so presumably this used to be normal. But I don’t remember what it was like back then to just let my thoughts die constantly. And now it’s a weird, alienating feeling.

While I’m tempted to go back to Facebook and resume my brain vomit, I’m resisting that urge. This is a chance for me to readjust to the normal circumstances of being a human being. If I really want to share my thoughts, I have to go directly to someone I want to share it with. This isn’t something that comes naturally to [an introvert like myself](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/introverts-extroverts-narcissists/), but it’s worth forcing myself to do it. And for those thoughts that aren’t worth sharing, I hope I can remember how to let them die in peace.
