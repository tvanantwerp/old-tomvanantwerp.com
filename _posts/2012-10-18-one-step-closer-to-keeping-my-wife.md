I just got back from the Post Office, where I mailed a small book’s worth of Val’s immigration forms. After the Department of Homeland Security cashes my $1,000+ check and shuffles my papers for a few months (or years), Valerie will finally have a green card. Hooray!

I feel bad for anyone who wants to come the the US and didn’t happen to fall in love with a citizen. Our ordeals have been bad enough. We were apart for an entire year just trying to get her a K-1 Fiancee visa. If you aren’t married to an American, it’s damn-near impossible to get into this country.

The US immigration system is a human rights travesty. I would put it up there with the War on Terror and the War on Drugs for “worst ways America screws the world”. Maybe I’ll rant more later about how much I hate the immigration process, but for now I’m just relieved to be done with yet another round of paperwork.
