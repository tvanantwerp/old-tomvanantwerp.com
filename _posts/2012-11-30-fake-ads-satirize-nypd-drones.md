Yeah, yeah, vandalism violates property rights, I get it, I get it! [That doesn’t make this any less awesome](http://reason.com/archives/2012/11/30/drones-invade-new-york-city).

> On September 16, 29-year-old “Essam” and a group of friends blanketed lower Manhattan with posters designed to look like official New York Police Department signage. “Drones: Protection When You Least Expect It,” read the slogan below simple ideograms of families running from unmanned aerial vehicles. Essam and his team disguised themselves as employees of the outdoor advertising firm Van Wagner, which manages the advertising space on bus stations and kiosks throughout the city. All told, they swapped out about 100 ads.

One of my personal rules of good street art is that it ought to make whatever it vandalizing better than it was before. This definitely qualifies.

> **Update**: Unsurprisingly, [the artist behind these posters has been arrested](http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/03/drone-poster-artist-arrested-nypd-does-n).
