This weekend is the 29th [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) competition. It’s like a hackathon for video games. Participants have 48 hours to build a video game from scratch.

When I was in high school, I dreamed of making my own video games. During college, I really drifted away from those early interests. But slowly I’m coming back to it as an aspiring programmer and professed [video game addict](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/addiction/).

One cool thing about this competition is that many of the participants are streaming video of themselves. It’s very fascinating to watch them work. They all use different languages and frameworks, but I love to see their thought process and to watch them test small parts of their games as they write them. Very fascinating stuff.

I’m not a good enough programmer to participate in something like Ludum Dare yet. But I hope one day I can fulfill my childhood dream and make a game, if only a small one. I’ve got lots of learning ahead of me, but watching pros do their thing so quickly is inspiring.

Programming can be hard. Even harder is programming quickly. I’ve made a point of learning not just languages and frameworks, but also tricks for [writing code fast](https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/). Focusing not just on raw knowledge, but also the workflow, has let me learn faster.

I won’t realize the dreams of my youth overnight, but I’ll keep working at it. I don’t think I’ll make a career of game development, but I’d be disappointed with myself if I never gave it a go. It’s too easy to grow up and surrender our dreams for something “realistic”.

All I know is that, so far, everything I’ve loved about my work is a result of pushing ever forward to do what I love without compromise.
