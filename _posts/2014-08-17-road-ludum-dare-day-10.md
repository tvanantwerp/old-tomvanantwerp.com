It’s been hard to blog about my preparation for Ludum Dare these past few days. I’m past the point of easy wins, and now it’s a slog to figure anything out. This is an absolutely normal part of learning anything new, but it still sucks. Yesterday, I spent an hour or two trying to get a parallaxing script from a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E5_Fquw7BM) to work. At first I thought it didn’t work at all. I checked and double-checked the code; it matched the tutorial. Finally, I figured out the script did work, but, for whatever reason, had only a tiny fraction of the effect as shown in the video. I cranked up the multiplier in the script and, finally it worked!

Except, not really. The parallaxing was working backwards! Distant mountains flew past while a pile of dirt two feet away sat perfectly still. I still don’t know why this script worked for the author of the tutorial, but not me. I tried in vain to make it do what I wanted. Eventually, I gave up and discovered [an easier way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIQFhEo1C8c) to implement simple parallaxing in Unity3D.

It was relatively easy to get sprites into a game and make them do things. I still have no idea how I’ll give characters health, or make enemies that try to kill you. There’s a lot more I need to learn to make a good game. I’ll have to keep pushing myself to learn, despite setbacks and emotional fluctuations. I have one week until Ludum Dare, and I **will** submit a game.
