Came home late from work today (thanks, [WMATA](http://www.wmata.com/)!), so I haven’t practiced for Ludum Dare too much tonight. I did finish [this tutorial video](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d/2d-controllers) and added jumping to my Sprite Guy [from yesterday](/road-ludum-dare-day-5/). I didn’t follow the tutorial exactly, as I don’t have a ready-to-go sprite sheet to work from with 11 frames of jumping. I figured, for practice, one sprite would work well enough.

I’m anxiously awaiting the theme of Ludum Dare. I likely won’t know enough by the time of the event to make anything too innovative. But I’d like to incorporate the theme well into whatever version of a platformer or shooter or whatever I manage to build. Making the art can take a while, and it’s the reason my Sprite Guy demos take as long as they do to make. I could probably get some theme-appropriate assets for the event, but that sucks some of the fun out of it. I enjoy making my own art, however crappy and time-consuming it is. Of course, I will save most art for last after building a functional game that [meets the goals I set forward in the beginning](/make-video-game-two-weeks/).
