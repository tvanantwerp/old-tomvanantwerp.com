Libertarians are used to fighting the long war for freedom. Wait it out, get a couple of good laws passed every decade, maybe get a few bad ones struck down. Keep up the fight for speech, privacy, free trade and personal liberty. Eventually, surely, we’ll win. It may take centuries, but we can do it.

Well, no. The scary truth of it is that we don’t have centuries. We’ve got a decade, maybe, if we’re lucky.

Why so pessimistic, you ask? Three reasons: the continued exponential growth in digital technology’s abilities, the proclivity of government to infiltrate opposition groups, and the problem of distributed costs and concentrated benefits.

Libertarians are most familiar with the [latter problem](http://www.learnliberty.org/videos/why-is-the-NRA-so-powerful). It’s basically the reason that lobbying works, and that many people in representational states still get screwed by big business and big government. A small but vocal minority with a lot to gain from government meddling will almost always win over the broader public which, faced with only a small marginal cost per person, won’t bother to fight against the lobbyists’ demands. This problem enables widespread subsidies, regulatory capture, and government bloat.

The first problem—increasing technological sophistication—usually isn’t considered a problem by libertarians. Many, if not most, see technology as a liberating force. And they are partly right. Technology has liberated us not only from a great deal of back-breaking labor, but also enabled popular revolt against oppressive regimes across the world. As I write this, Turkey and Brazil have both recently seen great turmoil in opposition to government excesses. Technologies like Twitter have played a key role in organizing such protests. Technology here destabilizes autocracy, and I think it deserves acknowledgement for that.

But tech is value neutral. It knows not whom it serves, nor why, nor is it capable of caring. The same technology that can foment rebellion can likewise quash it.

We already know that the [NSA has been intercepting nearly every communication from nearly every American](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/spyings-story-not-edward-snowden). We know about drone [surveillance](http://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/domestic-drones)/[assassination](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/new-evidence-that-team-obama-misled-us-about-the-drone-war/274839/). We know other countries are following suit. We know that [CCTV is more and more common](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22274770), and that traffic cameras can [ID and record license plates](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-06/license-plate-readers-automatically-create-big-data). We know that [phones can easily be used to track your location](http://www.aclu.org/protecting-civil-liberties-digital-age/cell-phone-location-tracking-public-records-request).

Widespread privacy is on it’s last legs. Combine what we know about the technical capacity to track any given person *right now* with projected ability in the near future. It won’t be so hard for government to track who you are, what you say, where you go, who you know, and what you’re doing together.

Now consider that the NSA, CIA, law enforcement, and military and security contractors are all small but vocal minorities who can easily outspend any opposition party both in the media and in terms of building tech infrastructure. Do you honestly think [these citizen drones](http://www.geek.com/news/turkish-drone-shooting-heralds-a-new-age-of-civillian-counter-surveillance-1559279/) can beat [these military drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWWE106qPVk)? Can your [homemade firearm](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/click-print-gun-the-inside-story-of-the-3d-printed-gun-movement-video) protect you from this [$17,000 beast](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/17000-linux-powered-rifle-brings-auto-aim-to-the-real-world/)? Will [crypto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) save you if your computer was [built to spy on you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger)?

So we know government has the means to mess up your life, and that it will only get worse. But what about motive? Several notable libertarians have argued that the NSA scandal isn’t a [big deal](http://reason.com/archives/2013/06/12/why-libertarians-have-better-things-to-w). Perhaps this is because they are relatively [affluent, successful, older white men](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/check-your-privilege). But they are very, very wrong to play down government surveillance. The US government, as only one example, has a [long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal) of [spying on](http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/31/mlk.fbi.conspiracy/) non-violent [groups](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/06/how-cia-aided-nypds-surveillance-program/66636/) who [challenge](http://www.salon.com/2013/06/02/is_the_government_spying_on_environmental_groups_partner/) the [status quo](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-nsa-spied-on-barack-obama-2004-russ-tice-2013-6). The fact that overly-broad laws and regulations lead to Americans [committing 3 felonies a day](http://www.threefeloniesaday.com/Youtoo/tabid/86/Default.aspx) makes it easy for an intelligence agency to blackmail literally anyone for any reason. Anybody who is somebody can be at risk.

Combine all these dynamics, and the future of liberty is in greater danger than ever before. All successful movements for social or political change require some element of privacy to plan and implement. With increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology being concentrated largely in hostile governments’ hands, that privacy is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. [Panopticon is coming](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/29/tomorrows-surveillance/). I don’t say this out of fear, nor as a threat; it is the logical conclusion of the trends I enumerated.

Libertarians have mostly flown under the radar in the past, probably because we [suck](/libertarians-arent-cool/) at everything. [This may not be so in the future](/will-libertarians-be-the-nsas-next-targets/). Our long-time strategy of pushing for change over the long-term time scale won’t work if, within the next few years, any unapproved expression of political philosophy is easily captured and recognized by digital surveillance. If the only place for a libertarian to safely be a libertarian is within his own head, then the movement is effectively dead.

Even if, somehow, government invasions of privacy are curtailed, it won’t stop similar privacy invasions from other actors. While civilian cell phone cameras and drones are comparatively low-tech next to government gear, they still work quite well. And as I pointed out earlier, all of this tech will only get better. The full publication of the private you is nearly inevitable. The future of individual privacy is an almost certain death.

The future is exciting and scary. It offers either the promise of unprecedented bounty, or eternal oppression. I have hope for the future, and for the power of libertarians to shape it in a positive way. But time runs short. We face threats to freedom unlike any others in the history of mankind. We operate on a timescale much shorter and bizarre than our antiquated monkey brains fully understand. The next few years may make or break us, and we need to appreciate the urgency of this situation.

If liberty is to have any hope, it’s time to get our act together and our asses into gear.
