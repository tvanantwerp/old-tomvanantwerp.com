This is one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever seen. If you [slay a red dragon](http://www.dungeoneers.com/promotions/figurine) and donate $8.20 to [LearnLiberty](http://www.learnliberty.org/), you can collect a pewter figurine of Ron Paul for you Dungeons and Dragons needs.

> Sharpen your swords because it is time to Slay a Dragon for Liberty. You can do that by slaying a Red Dragon and donating $8.20 to LearnLiberty.org.
>
> The first 200 Dragon Slayers for Liberty will receive [this miniature figurine](http://www.dungeoneers.com/promotions/figurine/details) of Ron Paul. (U.S. residents only).
>
> To slay a Red Dragon, you must win 5 games. With each win, you will face a more difficult dragon, until you are up against the dreaded Red Dragon. When you finish a game after having slain a Red Dragon, you will receive an email with instructions on donating the $8.20 and claiming your figurine. (Why $8.20? Because August 20th is Ron Paul’s birthday, of course!)
>
> We chose LearnLiberty.org because their short videos are excellent introductions to the intellectual basis of libertarian thought. Ron Paul’s core message was that we must learn about liberty in order to keep it. LearnLiberty.org is an excellent place to start.

As a professional non-profit fundraiser, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like this. It’s completely ridiculous! At no point in my career would I have ever thought, “Hey, I know what will raise money! A video game where people pretend to be Ron Paul and fight dragons in exchange for a tiny metal trinket!” I definitely wouldn’t have suggested it to my bosses! The entire concept is totally absurd.

Presently, I’m awaiting the arrival of my tiny pewter Paul in the mail…
