Since last week I’ve read about: mass surveillance, cyber warfare, treadmill desks, and the one-way trip to Mars you won’t be taking.

* [All Cameras are Police Cameras](http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/nor/2014/11/07/all-cameras-are-police-cameras/)
This is a compelling narrative of how technology is changing the mechanisms of state control. It begins with humble stone walls to restrict movement, and imagines a near-future where the Internet-connected wearables on our person are generating endless metadata about our activities. The most important part of the story, in my mind, is that consent is not really required: once the tech exists and permeates society, there is little to stop its use and abuse.
* [Son of Stuxnet](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/11/12/stuxnet/) by [Kim Zetter](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/staff/kim-zetter/)
Son probably isn’t accurate. More likely it’s a sibling, or even a parent. But that’s not the important bit. What’s important is that malware which is most likely US-Israeli in origin is being used to spy on certificate authorities that verify the authenticity of computer software. Imagine NSA malware having the ability to masquerade as a Windows update that legitimately passes security checks.
* [The Cubicle Gym](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7186667/office-fitness-exercises-stretches) by [Gregory Ferenstein](http://www.vox.com/users/ferenstein)
While I don’t think I’m about to spring for the treadmill desk, this is still and impressive look at employing the [quantified self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) mindset to improve health and well-being. I’m a big fan of QS myself, and you can see some of my own experiments here ([1](/returns-leisure/), [2](/addiction/), [3](/returns-leisure-part-2/)) and [here](/quitting-facebook/).
* [All Dressed Up for Mars and Nowhere to Go](https://medium.com/matter/all-dressed-up-for-mars-and-nowhere-to-go-7e76df527ca0) by Elmo Keep
Mars One made news when they announced their plans for a one-way mission to Mars and opened up applications for volunteers.But there are two things they haven’t made: rocket ships, or several billion dollars to buy someone else’s rocket ships. This is a fantastically in-depth look at the real scientific and economic challenges to planetary exploration and colonization, and why Mars One is probably not the group to solve them.
