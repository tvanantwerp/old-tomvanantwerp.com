When a libertarian is asked, “Should gay people be able to get married?”, what is the correct answer?

**“YES.”**

The answer is not, “The state shouldn’t be involved in marriage in the first place!” Ok, yeah, I agree. But it’s not relevant. The national debate has not been, is not, and isn’t about to be: “Should the government be in charge of marriage, or involved with it in any way?” That would be a great debate to have, and libertarians have very important things to say in that debate. But that’s not the question we’re having right now. In the world we live in, under the system we’ve got, whether we like things this way or not, should gay people be able to marry? It’s an easy question, and the answer is yes.

That’s it. That’s all you have to say. “Yes.” You’ve fully answered the question. If you’re feeling a bit verbose, you could even say, “Yes, gay people should be able to get married.” But a simple “yes” is still just fine.

But if you go into some 15 minute rant against The State, anyone who isn’t already libertarian (and even most who are) will just tune you out. Many gay couples want to get married. Few want to hear your thoughts on the nature and scope of government.

They’ve got priorities. If you really want to protect liberty, you should have priorities too.

Should gays be able to marry? Yes.
