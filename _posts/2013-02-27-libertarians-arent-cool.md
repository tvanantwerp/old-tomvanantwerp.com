description: "Coolness should matter to libertarians because it’s not an action, but an outcome. Consuming popular products and services does not make one cool; but creating them can. No one is cool because they saw the big game, but athletes are cool for playing in it. No one is cool for owning an iPhone, but Steve Jobs is cool for creating it. And studying libertarian theory all day will never be as cool as making it manifest."

Angelina Johnston, a member of the Young Americans for Liberty chapter at my [always inspiring alma mater](http://thefire.org/torch/#15477), [writes](http://unclibertarians.com/do-libertarians-have-a-branding-problem/):

> If you went to the (fantastically successful) ISFLC 2013 two weeks ago, you probably noticed that a lot of people think that Libertarians have a branding issue. … Magatte Wade, a TED Global Africa Fellow and a Libertarian, [thinks Libertarians are uncool, buttoned up, and read too much](http://studentsforliberty.org/uncategorized/magatte-wades-isflc-sunday-keynote-speak-from-the-heart/). … She insisted that no one is drawn to the Libertarian Party because we know so much about philosophy and that that sort of insistence on intellectual study can sometimes be off-putting to people interested in the Libertarian Party. … Should Libertarians, as Wade suggests, try to wear fashionable clothes or worry less about learning about Libertarian philosophy? Should Libertarians try to be cool?

A lack of coolness among libertarians is absolutely a problem. I don’t mean that we all need to dress fashionably or listen to pop music. I mean that when we corner strangers at a party and try to bash their statist brains in with our economic theories, we aren’t going to win many friends.

Angelina misunderstands what coolness is and how you acquire it. Coolness is about taking responsibility for yourself, your reputation, and the actual outcomes of your actions.

Coolness is not reading the libertarian canon and trying to change the world by forcing everyone else to read it too.

Libertarians who want to share the ideals of liberty are often uncool because they don’t take responsibility for themselves. It’s so easy for a radical individualist to justify poor hygiene, off-putting personality, and a lack of non-libertarian interests as self-expression. And playing the victim can be more emotionally satisfying than putting in the hard work and still failing sometimes. Libertarians would rather blame other people for rejecting liberty. It’s comforting to shift the blame, to call unbelievers “statist”, and to be offensive rather than effective.

This is a broad generalization, and I’m lucky to know many cool libertarians. What makes most of them cool is that they do take responsibility for themselves, as an honest libertarian should. They don’t just read about liberty; they practice it. They don’t care about ideas to the exclusion of everything else. They pursue non-libertarian interests, such as reading books that aren’t by economists, practicing graphic design or videography, writing software, starting companies or completing marathons. They don’t care much about minarchy versus anarchy, *Libertarians* versus **libertarians**, Beltway versus everywhere else, or Objectivists versus other Objectivists versus everybody else. Those things aren’t important, and people who do care about it usually aren’t important either.

Coolness should matter to libertarians because it’s not an action, but an outcome. Consuming popular products and services does not make one cool; but *creating* them can. No one is cool because they saw the big game, but athletes are cool for playing in it. No one is cool for owning an iPhone, but Steve Jobs is cool for creating it. And studying libertarian theory all day will never be as cool as making it manifest.

Should libertarians try to be cool? Yes. But first we must be people who do cool things.
