As a libertarian, I always hear about investing in precious metals. Since I got interested in Ron Paul in 2007, I’ve continually heard about the wonders of buying gold. [Ron Paul himself is a big fan of gold and silver](http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2011/12/21/the-ron-paul-portfolio/). When I went to [FreedomFest](http://freedomfest.com/) for the first time last summer, I was shocked to discover that most speakers and exhibitors were all investment firms—and they all were selling gold! Expecting a convention of libertarians discussing ideas and celebrating freedom, I felt like Christ entering the Temple and finding it full of hawkers. I guess I can’t be too upset—Las Vegas casinos aren’t exactly holy ground, and I am definitely not Jesus. But still, it all felt like a bait-and-switch scam designed to trick old people into surrendering their savings.

Lately, the market backs me up. Now [Ron Paul is likely feeling the pinch](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ron-paul-portfolio-has-been-getting-crushed-2013-3) as his gold-backed investments are dropping in value. Sadly for Ron, it was entirely predictable that gold wouldn’t work in the long run.

At the extremes, there are two outcomes for the global economy over time: continued growth despite our awful political systems and market interference, or total collapse. I typically bet on the first outcome, but some libertarians like Ron bet on the second. I can’t fault people for wanting to hedge against total global economic collapse. But choosing gold as that hedge is simply poor planning.

Why is gold a poor hedge against total economic ruin? For the same reasons it’s a poor hedge against the zombie apocalypse!

In the event of the zombie apocalypse, your likely goal will be to keep yourself and your loved ones alive. To accomplish this, you will need supplies: stores of food, access to fresh water, fortified shelter, and weapons to defend yourselves from roaming hoards of undead. The absolute last thing you’ll need are a couple of bricks of heavy metal weighing you down.

If the global economy ever went completely to hell and we were thrown back to a medieval level of subsistence, gold (or certificates in gold miners’ stock) wouldn’t help you one bit. Like the zombie apocalypse, you’d have to survive without all the infrastructure you’ve been relying on to live comfortably these many years. You should buy food, farming equipment, and maybe a copy of *Agriculture for Dummies*.

And like the zombie apocalypse, desperately hungry and violent individuals would be roaming around in search of resources. They’d have no problem killing you to take yours. Unless you’ve bought enough gold to build a fort out of it, you’ll probably want to buy guns and bullets, swords, spears or some other effective killing tool.

I find the zombie apocalypse as unlikely as complete global economic collapse, but I don’t fault anyone for trying to be prepared for anything. Just remember that in the worst case scenario, gold has a practical value of zero.
