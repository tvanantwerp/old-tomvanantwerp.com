Over at the New York Times’ [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/in-silicon-valley-technology-talent-gap-threatens-g-o-p-campaigns/) blog, Nate Silver echoes [my earlier sentiments](/the-data-driven-political-machine/) on the Republican Party’s failure to court young and tech-savvy supporters.

Mr. Romney’s get-out-the-vote application, Project Orca, is widely viewed as having failed on Election Day, perhaps contributing to a disappointing Republican turnout.

If the GOP doesn’t adopt libertarian stances, it will literally grow old and die. Not only will they find themselves out of touch with newer generations, but they will grow slow and brittle by comparison.
