Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to [life in prison without possibility of parole](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-creator-ross-ulbricht-sentenced-life-prison/). Since then, I've seen many fellow libertarians and friends taking a stand against this sentencing. I have a harder time empathizing with Ulbricht than they do.

This is a man who thought he was paying assassins to kill people. And yes, I recognize that he was not being tried for those crimes in this case. But separating trials does not somehow separate the Ulbricht sentenced to life for creating the Silk Road from the Ulbricht who wanted certain people dead. Ross Ulbricht is not a libertarian hero; he is a would-be murderer. I might feel differently about Ulbricht if all he ever did was create the Silk Road, but that's just not the reality.

As for the sentence being overly harsh: that might be true. Lots of people have probably caused more physical harm in the world and received lighter punishments. But there's nothing about this sentence that surprises me. The Silk Road was built to pose an existential threat to the Drug War. Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts explicitly stated that [his actions were directed at undermining The State](http://tomvanantwerp.com/the-political-philosophy-of-a-crypto-kingpin/), and he made himself into a symbol for that cause. It should shock no one that the government came down extremely hard on him.

Ulbricht's sentence is not the tragic part of the Silk Road story. The tragedy came when Ulbricht's youthful idealism was abandoned in favor of violent enforcement. His legacy as a hero of peace and freedom died when he made that choice to kill.
