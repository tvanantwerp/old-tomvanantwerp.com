It’s hard to believe that I’ve had this name for a quarter century, give or take, but only just bought the domain for it.

This is my personal blog where I’ll be talking about whatever I damn well please. I plan to talk about personal projects, go on insane rants, brag, embarrass myself, and otherwise dump the miscellaneous contents of my brain here. I hope you find it distracting in a good way.
