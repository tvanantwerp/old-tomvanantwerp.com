About a week ago, I read a complaint from my friend Casey Given about [whiny introverts](http://caseygiven.com/2014/01/02/sorry-introverts-youre-not-special-youre-human-beings-like-the-rest-of-us/). I recognized that many of the things he was saying were true. “Internet introverts” are quick to complain about extroverts. Many do act as if they are somehow oppressed.

But there was something not quite right about Casey’s account of introversion. I am without a doubt an introvert, and I know that many attitudes he described were not mine. I don’t hate extroverts nor look down on them. Rather the opposite, I wish I possessed their natural social intelligence. I dream of how much easier life would be if I were born with that innate talent and passion for building relationships. [Some biological traits just make life easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY), and extroversion is obviously one of them.

I don’t think of extroverts as loquacious, dim-witted oppressors. That’s obviously absurd. The feeling more closely approximates this: Imagine that we are, all of us, NBA players. Introverts like myself are [Muggsy Bogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggsy_Bogues). Sure, we’re playing, but everyone is kind of surprised they let us in and we’re surely never going to be a Michael Jordan. And it’s not because we’re being oppressed, but because we’re just naturally at a physical disadvantage. We can work around it and find some success, but it’s not something you can just get over.

I think that’s partly why I took issue with Casey’s piece. His tone equated to a message of “suck it up, wuss”. Um, no. Doesn’t work that way. If someone had told Muggsy to suck it up and grow two feet taller, that would not have happened. Similarly, I can’t just suck it up and rewire my brain to be more of a people-person.

But I can understand why Casey feels the way he does. Even though I harbor no ill will toward extroverts, I’ve seen enough allegedly introverted people hating them online to justify a harsh response.

I struggled to write a response to Casey’s piece. I knew that some people thought and acted as Casey described, but I also knew that I wasn’t one of them. And yet we were lumped together under the label “introvert”. But I think now I have a proper response, courtesy of Scientific American: [23 Signs You’re Secretly a Narcissist Masquerading as a Sensitive Introvert](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/2013/08/26/23-signs-youre-secretly-a-narcissist-masquerading-as-a-sensitive-introvert/).

> Now, do genuinely introverted people exist? Absolutely. … But the latest research suggests that there is also a large selfish segment of the population who say they are introverted and sensitive when they really just can’t stand it that everyone doesn’t recognize their brilliance.

I believe that Casey wasn’t attacking introverted people so much as narcissistic people who use introversion as a cover for self-centered behavior. This covert narcissism certainly is a bad attitude worthy of criticism, but it doesn’t describe my introversion at all.

I want to be angry at Casey for attributing such bad behavior to introverts like myself based on the actions of others who have abused that label, but I can’t. I’m also a libertarian, and I have far too much experience being criticized for views I don’t actually hold thanks to the abusers of that label already. I’m just numb to it.

I do want to tell all of my friends that I’m sorry if I’ve ever let you down. I know I’m not good at being sociable, keeping in touch, or asking you all to hang out. I don’t take you all for granted—I am very grateful to know so many awesome people. Forgive my clumsy efforts to build and maintain our friendship. If I’ve put you off, please know that it was probably unintentional. I’m working constantly to be a better friend. Please be patient with me, because it really is hard work. I may never be great at it, but know that I will always be trying.
