Since 2009, I have sporadically tracked my diet through various food logging apps. First there was [DailyBurn](http://dailyburn.com/), then [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/), and most recently with [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/). And over these past several years, I've come to one conclusion: food logging doesn't work.

I'm ordinarily a big fan of quantifying my behavior toward the end of improving it. However, measuring food inputs hasn't helped me to manage my weight. Looking at recorded caloric intake and weight from November 2014 to June 2015, the caloric trends don't closely follow my day-to-day weight. The only exception is from late February through March when I had [diverticulitis](http://tomvanantwerp.com/diverticulosis/) and basically could not eat. That month proves that reducing my caloric intake by an extreme amount will in fact result in weight loss. However, during normal periods of time, the caloric intake did not line up with weight trends.

A major reason my caloric data and weight data don't line up is that my caloric data is probably wrong. Recording food intake is not a straightforward process. Even with the help of an app like MyFitnessPal, the process is prone to bad estimates and user error.

I often forget to record meals in the moment, and have to remember to record them later. This is especially true during social situations. I usually forget precisely what I ate. And small snacks, like a piece of candy, usually never get recorded.

I'm also reliant on MyFitnessPal's food database, which is fine if I only ever ate at chain restaurants with widely published nutrition facts. Between my wife's authentic Chinese cooking and fusion cuisine food trucks, many of my meals aren't in the database and I'm forced to pick a best-guess substitute.

It's so much work to accurately record meals that I often slip out of the habit, as seen by the gaps in the previous chart. And just because I do have data for a given date doesn't mean that I remembered to record everything, or that I recorded it correctly. I would guess that I typically ate more than I recorded for any given day.

Finally, the most embarassing reason why food logging hasn't worked: it does not guide my behavior. If I'm hungry, I'm going to eat. Whether or not I'm exceeding my intake goal by doing so is irrelevant. I'm evolved to respond to hunger pangs, not spreadsheets. Between staying under X number of calories, and eating a tasty dinner, I choose dinner every time.

After reviewing my data and the shortcomings of the food logging process, I've decided to give it up. I'm still intent on managing my diet, but I know that this method doesn't work for me. And I'm not going to continue wasting time and effort on something that isn't working.
