I'm an IT professional, a developer, and a graphic designer. And I confess: I don't use Apple products.

It's not that I dislike Apple. But their products have traditionally been pricey, and I've traditionally been poor. And I work at a think tank, not a start-up. I've had to cajole economists into giving up on their Windows XP machines; it's fair to say that switching us all to Macs won't happen. At home I've got a desktop that I built myself for a fraction of the price of a comparable Apple machine. My phone is a Nexus 6 running Android 5.1, and I'm very happy with it. I've played with my wife's iPhone, and while it's got some nice features (especially the camera), it isn't so great that I feel compelled to switch.

And, to all the strangers in public who keep asking, no, [I am not wearing an Apple watch](http://tomvanantwerp.com/watch/)...

I'm not opposed to using Apple products. They are certainly well-designed. What frustrates me is the attitude of many people who are already 100% Apple users.

I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts when the guest, discussing apps he uses, noted that there weren't Android versions available. Then he flippantly added: "But who uses Android anyway?" Well, unless Sundar Pichai was lying at Google I/O this past week, [8 out of every 10 new smartphone buyers are using Anroid](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/googles-io-developers-conference-live-blog/#entry_55).

I just don't understand why a person would choose to needlessly alienate people over what tech they choose to use. What personal purpose does that serve? This individual was part of the start-uppy clique that, as a lifelong East-coaster and current DC resident, I've never encountered in person. In his world, maybe nobody does use Android or anything else. But it still struck me as an odd, offensive thing to say.

When I first began working in IT, I was told something wise by another IT pro:

> The changes you make will not eliminate problems. You will take the set of problems you have, trade them for a new set of problems, and hope that you're better on net.

Hearing some people talk about Apple products, I wonder if understand this. Sure, Apple's goods might make me better on net. But they wouldn't eliminate all my problems, and they'd probably introduce some new ones. Apple might actually be better for me, but it wouldn't be—can't be—perfect.

I can't afford to let any perception of what products are "best" bias me against the solutions that will actually work for my team. Economists aren't Stanford CS grads working 80-hour weeks for equity; they are typically lifelong Windows users who don't find it worthwhile to relearn everything they thought they new about computing. (They would call that an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).) Sure, some use iPhones; others use Android, or Windows Phone, or don't own a cell phone at all.

When I do introduce new hardware, software, or workflow standards, it's never adopted instantly and without issue. I have to do lots of training, explaining, troubleshooting, and demonstrating. I have to be patient and recognize that I'm not coming from the place they are coming from. The job requires empathy as much as technical skill. It's not easy to manage that, but I try.

If you use Apple and you love it, great. But I hope you can also accept that other people sometimes use other products that they love, and that's OK too. Because honestly, isn't the phone in your pocket or the computer on your desk a stupid reason to be divisive?
