This morning I was catching up on my RSS feeds after a holiday hiatus, and I noticed two stories from [Reason Magazine](http://reason.com/):

* [Egypt Gets a New Constitution](http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/26/egypt-gets-a-new-constitution)
* [New Hampshire Democrat: ‘Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today’](http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/27/new-hampshire-democrat-free-staters-are)

On the surface, these two stories don’t really have much in common. The first tells how an uneducated but large and religious Egyptian populace has enable the creation of a new Egyptian constitution based in Sharia law. The second is about Democrats complaining that libertarians and anarchists are moving into their state and making it generally unpleasant. The [*who, what, when, where and why*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) are totally different between the two.

But the *how* is the same: democracy.

Egypt, after ridding itself of authoritarian rule, turned to democratic institutions to protect itself from such oppression again. But protesters made the mistake—as so many do—that democracy is the wellspring of liberty. But correlation is not causation, and imitating Western democracy has only enabled a new type of authoritarianism to take hold in Egypt. Reason writes:

> And while the government blamed unrest on a [“small but powerful minority”](http://reason.com/24-7/2012/12/10/morsi-aide-blames-egyptian-unrest-on-sma) supporters of the opposition saw it the other way around. “70 percent of the Egyptian people are ignorant and illiterate, and the 70 percent now control the 30 percent of the population who are educated,” one female voter told [euronews](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pup2cqG8CmY) in Egypt. … The Muslim Brotherhood had long been banned in Egypt, helping it become the [only real opposition force in Egypt](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1981368,00.html) despite [losses](http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20101129-egypt-opposition-muslim-brotherhood-faces-heavy-losses) in elections that came in the twilight of the Mubarak era.

The protesters, who may well have wanted a free and secular society like those in the West, have lost that opportunity. Many Western societies—and those of Anglo-Saxon origin in particular—have centuries old traditions of individual liberty which moderate the vices of democratic governance. Egypt has no such traditions. By choosing first democracy rather than liberty, they put their cart before the camel. Now they may get neither.

Meanwhile in New Hampshire, locals are complaining about libertarian-minded [Free Staters](http://freestateproject.org/) moving in and getting involved in local politics. Says District 8 State Representative Cynthia Chase of Keene:

> In the opinion of this Democrat, Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today. There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal.

While I probably have more in common with Free Staters than any far-left New Hampshire locals, I do sympathize with Chase. I’m from the South, and we still remember [carpetbagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger). I’ve heard stories of contemporary carpetbaggers who move from the North to Southern communities, take control of local politics, raise property taxes to force out substantially poorer locals, and buy up land to turn into condos for their retiring Yankee comrades. I can understand the anger and frustration of locals who feel like their communities are being eroded by malicious outsiders.

The Egyptian protesters thought democracy could bring them freedom, but it brought them theocracy. The locals of New Hampshire thought democracy would protect their established way of life, but it has instead enabled radical reform by outsiders. These groups both made the same mistake: they believed that democracy is *de facto* good.

But democracy isn’t good. And it isn’t bad either. Democracy is math. Democracy is 50% + 1 wins. It doesn’t uphold morality or tear it down; it simply empowers whichever group is largest to make the rules.

In this way, democracy is like a gun. There’s nothing special about the bits of metal that comprise a gun. A hunk of metal isn’t inherently good or evil. But whether the use of that gun is just or unjust is a matter of who uses it and why. When democratic governments answer to people who believe in freedom and tolerance, then that’s what you’ll get. But it can just as well answer to more sinister ideals if they are widely held.

We in the West too often forget that democracy isn’t good or bad; it’s just a reflection of most people who live under it.

> **Update**: It seems that peeved New Hampshire local Cynthia Chase [isn’t a NH local at all](http://freekeene.com/2012/12/27/youre-not-welcome-here-says-the-nh-state-rep-from-rhode-island/). I think my point still stands, but wow. Can’t say I feel any more sympathy for Cynthia Chase.
