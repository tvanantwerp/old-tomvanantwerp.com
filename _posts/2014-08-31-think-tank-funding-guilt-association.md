description: "Working at a public policy think tank in DC, I’ve often seen people in the media and at competing policy groups attack the funders of think tanks rather than debate their ideas and research. Very often these attacks will focus on a handful of funders whose contributions don’t constitute a sizeable amount of total revenues, but whose public brand is toxic enough to wear off on the think tank in question. It’s an ad hominem by proxy: if people loathe any subset of your donors, then everything you do is instantly invalid. It’s lazy, dishonest, and disgustingly effective."

Working at a public policy think tank in DC, I’ve often seen people in the media and at competing policy groups attack the funders of think tanks rather than debate their ideas and research. Very often these attacks will focus on a handful of funders whose contributions don’t constitute a sizeable amount of total revenues, but whose public brand is toxic enough to wear off on the think tank in question. It’s an *ad hominem* by proxy: if people loathe any subset of your donors, then everything you do is instantly invalid. It’s lazy, dishonest, and disgustingly effective.

Because I’m an insane and obsessive individual, I wanted to put a number to how much of public discourse surrounding a think tank involves their funding. As a proxy measure, I chose to use the length of discussion of funding for the [top ten US think tanks](http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoToReport2013.pdf) on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I used these think tank rankings to eliminate personal bias in which think tanks should be examined. I chose Wikipedia because it’s publicly editable and may represent the degree to which funding sources are brought up regarding certain think tanks.* Here is a summary of what I found:

| Name | Characters Describing Funding | Individual Funders Named | Foundation Funders Named | Corporate Funders Named |
|:--- | ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|
| Brookings Institution | 524 | 2 | 5 | 2 |
| Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Center for Strategic and International Studies | 303 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| RAND Corporation | 159 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Council on Foreign Relations | 278 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | 441 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Pew Research Center | 138 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Heritage Foundation | 867 | 1 | 5 | 0 |
| Cato Institute | 3073 | 8 | 10 | 10 |
| Center for American Progress | 725 | 5 | 0 | 0 |

Full data are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tvanantwerp/tva-blog-data/tree/master/think-tanks-funding).

Many of these think tanks are large research organizations with apolitical missions and sizeable endowments. And honestly, I don’t know much about what they do. The last three, however, stick out as distinctly ideological in their approach to public policy research: the [Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/) (conservative), the [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org/) (libertarian), and the [Center for American Progress](http://www.americanprogress.org/) (liberal/progressive).

Each of these three has greater length of discussion of funders than any of the other think tanks in the US top ten. Cato Institute has the most discussion by far, at more than three times the length of the second-lengthiest Heritage Foundation. Cato’s funding discussion also explicitly names 8 individuals (including two Koch brothers), 10 foundations, and 10 corporations. While I can understand explaining Cato’s history with the Kochs, there is no apparent rationale behind most of the choices.

What’s almost equally interesting is what isn’t said about the similarly-sized but left-leaning Center for American Progress. Its Wikipedia page [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress#Funding) that it received support from 58 different foundations between 2003 and 2007. None are listed. It also links to a [list of corporate donors](http://www.americanprogress.org/about/our-supporters/) that CAP makes publicly available, but doesn’t bother to name any of them. That list of 58 companies includes 10 financial companies, 7 telecommunications companies, 8 medical/pharmaceutical/insurance companies, and 2 defense contractors. Last I checked, companies in these industries weren’t terribly popular with the left-of-center crowd.

There doesn’t appear to be much difference in the availability of funder information for these ideological think tanks. That suggests that differences in the volume and tone of funding discussion come down to the decisions of the people who authored those sections of the Wikipedia articles.

My cursory survey seems to indicate that a libertarian group like Cato is more likely to have it’s funding sources publicly discussed than either left- or right-wing think tanks. I would be very interested to see how this data looks for more think tanks, particularly those people tend to associate with particular ideological positions. This data is, however, a pain to gather manually. I don’t think I’ll be trying to compile or analyze it myself. I’d also like to think of some other, probably better, data sources I could use to measure this type of political attack. Feel free to email or tweet suggestions to me.

Note on data: Because Wikipedia is editable by anyone at any time, these numbers are likely to change. Additionally, these data may reflect public discussion of think tank funding. They may also represent the discussion of a small handful of interested individuals. I did not conduct a thorough examination of page histories to determine the activity surrounding the writing up of funding sources. I fully acknowledge that these data may not indicate anything of significance.

Disclosure: I am not affiliated with any of these think tanks at the time of writing this post. I have been inside Cato’s building before. It was OK, I guess.
