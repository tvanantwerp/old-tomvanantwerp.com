description: "Hong Kong does have a very free economy. But economics isn’t everything. Hong Kong is also very culturally conservative. Women are not treated as well as men, ethnicities are treated differently, different cultures face discrimination—and don’t even think about using drugs; the laws there make America’s worst drug penalties look like a slap on the wrist. Hong Kong is free in a lot of ways that matter, but it’s not free in a lot of other ways that matter."

Writing in the obviously left-wing American Prospect, [Paul Waldman](http://prospect.org/article/not-fun-visit-and-you-wouldnt-want-live-there-taxes-are-low) criticizes the recently-released [Freedom in the 50 States](http://freedominthe50states.org/) rankings from the [Mercatus Center](http://mercatus.org/). The report highlights the five freest states (in order) as North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, New Hampshire and Oklahoma. Waldman’s criticism is that, free as they may be, they really aren’t very desirable places to live.

He’s right, of course.

I first became skeptical of lists like this as a proxy for “good place to be” after having lived in Hong Kong, which consistently ranks as the [freest economy](http://www.heritage.org/index/country/hongkong) in the world. And Hong Kong does have a very free economy. I love that about it, and my wife still hasn’t quite forgiven me for taking her away from that environment. But economics isn’t everything. Hong Kong is also very culturally conservative. Women are not treated as well as men, ethnicities are treated differently, different cultures face discrimination—and don’t even think about using drugs; the laws there make America’s worst drug penalties look like a slap on the wrist. Hong Kong is free in a lot of ways that matter, but it’s not free in a lot of other ways that matter.

Mercatus’s list is similar in that regard. Lots of these “free” places are listed as such mostly because of low taxes (28.6% of the weighted score). But low taxes don’t say much about the quality of life in a place. It doesn’t tell you how you’ll be treated if you’re not white, or homosexual (marriage freedom is 2.1% of the score), or enjoy recreational drug use (marijuana/salvia freedom is 2.1% of the score). And it doesn’t begin to capture the value of *freedom multipliers*—intangible conditions like great year-round weather or cultural diversity—that make being free even better, or at least make less freedom somewhat tolerable.

This doesn’t mean the progressive states are *de facto* nicer places to live than the economically free ones. The very progressive nation of Denmark has ranked as the happiest country in the world, but I will never forget the miserable winter I spent there and what an awful place it can be if you’re poor and crave sunlight. I’m as inclined to call B.S. on those ranking as I am Mercatus’s.

I doubt Waldman and I would agree much on matters of public policy, but we both agree that freedom means something more than what the Mercatus Center’s (and others’) freedom indices are measuring.
