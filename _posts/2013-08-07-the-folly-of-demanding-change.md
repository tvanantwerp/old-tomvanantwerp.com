Every time it’s uncovered that the government has done something awful in secret—roughly once a week—I see a common reaction from concerned citizens. They hate what is happening and they want it to stop, naturally. I’m in total agreement so far. And then they outline their plan for reform: demand change. Yes, that’s it. Just get involved, go out in the streets and protest one predesignated day, or sign the petitions, or vote for some other guy. It’s a suggestion so hopelessly detached from the reality of how contemporary government (or probably any government, ever) functions that I can’t help but [facepalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg).

If I had to blame something for such naïveté, I guess I would blame civics education. Most Americans are raised with a very idealistic story of government. We have a representative democracy which bends to the will of the people, and it is therefore a benevolent force in the world. In terms of stories we tell children that encourage lifelong immaturity and ignorance, I’d put this narrative up there with “you’re a special snowflake”, “follow your dreams”, and “just be yourself”.

Well, you’re not special; your genes are only marginally different from everyone else’s. Your dreams of being a millionaire celebrity rockstar/athlete/actor have a statistically trivial chance of success. You shouldn’t be yourself if yourself doesn’t like bathing, putting on pants, or doing anything but play video games all day long. And the government? Yeah, they don’t represent you, and they don’t exist for your own well-being.

I’ve been living in Washington, DC, for a couple of years now—more than enough time to “see how the sausage is made”. The political antics you see on TV are as representative of actual government as reality TV is representative of reality. Politicians steal the show, but they aren’t the ones putting on the production. A great deal of decisions are made by unelected bureaucrats who face little to no oversight. Their decisions are virtually impossible to undo, and they create new regulations with the force of law at a rate between [10 and 50 times](http://www.openmarket.org/2013/01/29/the-anti-democracy-index/) as often as Congress passes new laws.

These bureaucrats may be influenced by ideology or their politician bosses, but they are definitely not influenced by your votes or your protests or your petitions. There’s a protest in DC every day; to a bureaucrat, it’s more like bad weather than anything else. Anything short of a million-strong lynch mob with pitchforks and torches wouldn’t faze them.

This bureaucrat class has the real power in government, not your so-called representatives.

Consider the NSA spying scandal. Most members of Congress knew nothing about what the NSA was doing. Those few who were briefed were likely told half-truths. Even Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, who introduced the Patriot Act in the House, was shocked by the scope of the government surveillance state when it was revealed. The politicians are simply not involved in the bureaucracy of the surveillance state. To quote [Bruce Sterling](https://medium.com/geek-empire-1/a1ebd2b4a0e5): “An American Senator knows as much about PRISM and XKeyScore as a troll-doll on the dashboard knows about internal combustion.”

Can you name the director of the NSA? How about any of his employees? Do you know the members of Congress tasked with oversight of the NSA? If you can, do you live in a region where you personally get to vote for or against that person? If you find these questions difficult, it’s because the NSA—like most government agencies—is a bureaucracy, not a democracy. You don’t actually get a say in how they operate, and they prefer it that way.

I have nothing against voting, or political activism. If you want to march, march. If you want to cast a ballot, cast it. But if you do these things under the belief that this, in isolation, will change society for the better, then you don’t understand how government works.

So, how do we reform government and change society? It’s a tricky problem, and one that I don’t think anyone has yet solved in the space of a Reddit comment. But I think the first steps involve taking responsibility not just for your level of civic activism, but also you civic innovation. If we take the market as an example, the best way to kill an abusive, bureaucratic monopoly power is to innovate it out of business. Cars killed the horse and buggy, video killed the radio star, and Elon Musk is killing NASA. Creating new technologies and lifestyles that governments can’t easily adapt to may be the quickest and most effective means of change. Governments fight back harder than most companies, and with dirtier tactics, but it still seems to me the best route to eroding the power of the implacable bureaucrat class.
