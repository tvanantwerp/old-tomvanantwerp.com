Recently, a young man murdered a number of people. It’s a tragedy, and I’m sorry for the innocent people who lost their lives and for their families and friends. And that is all I can tell you about it.

I don’t know the name of the murderer. I certainly don’t know the names of the victims. I’m not entirely sure when the murders happened, or where, or how. But I know *why*. Oh, do I know why!

Every day, I am told why. People were screaming why before I even heard about the what. The why is misogyny, rape culture, objectification of women and an entitlement mentality among men.

But not *all* men, right? I’m told that a lot too. But that’s not helpful, and it makes excuses. That’s what some other people reply. I don’t really know.

Every day when I check my Facebook or Twitter or any other social media, these are the things I am told. My feeds are full of this explanation or that, lamentations or defenses of cultural phenomenon, and endless shouting matches about why this tragic event happened and who is to blame. (I don’t think anyone has suggested we blame the killer yet.)

There’s a reason I don’t even know the killer’s name, or the details of the event. I haven’t seen one person I follow, nor one person I’ve friended, simply say: “So-and-so Evil Guy committed a horrible murder and we should be angry and sad at this senseless loss of life.” Nobody. Not a single news article shared—just commentary and opinion and flame wars in comment threads. At no point has the discussion of the crime been about the crime.

No one cares about the dead, and they barely care about the murderer. It’s about posturing. It’s a chance to push one world view or another. It’s *political*.

And watching it all play out on my screen—today for this, and yesterday for some other crisis and tomorrow for yet another horror—I’m left asking myself a question:

*What is wrong with you people?*
