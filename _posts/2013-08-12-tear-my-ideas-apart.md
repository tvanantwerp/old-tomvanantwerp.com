Despite working at a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, I’ve got an entrepreneurial spirit. No, seriously! I keep lists of projects I want to try, and work on those projects whenever I get the chance. I very much want to move forward on some of these ideas, but my time is scarce and I’m uncertain what to do or where to begin. So I thought I’d have a big ‘ole brain vomit on the blog, and see what sticks.

So, dear readers, you are cordially invited to review, judge, and critique all of my ideas listed below. (Comments at the bottom, unless it’s broken again—in that case, just [email me](mailto:tom@tomvanantwerp.com).)

## Kickstart my own deck of playing cards

I’ve talked about other [decks of crowdfunded playing cards](/kickstarter-playing-card-fetish/) before. The other week, I actually broke down and bought a deck of [Misc. Goods Co.](https://misc-goods-co.myshopify.com/) cards, and they are *beautiful*. I really want to try making a deck of my own, and I’ve already planned out the details. My only real bottleneck is finding the time to illustrate them.

My plan is to illustrate a deck of playing cards themed after contemporary protests/revolutions, such as Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. Half the deck would have a protester theme (spades and hearts), and the other a status quo theme (clubs and diamonds). I’ve done some illustration for the first card, the [King of Clubs](http://dribbble.com/shots/1127694-Secret-Project-1?list=users) (a riot cop with baton).

I would love to complete this project, but my busy freelancing schedule has kept me from working on this for the past month or two. Of the projects listed here, it’s the only one I’m certain I can complete with the skills I already have. However, this project may have a limited potential for profitability (need at least $5000 to cover printing, and would be thrilled to make that much). This would most likely be a project I complete for the love of it, if nothing else.

## A/B Testing App for Graphic Designers

One of my favorite websites is [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/tvanantwerp), which is best described as social network where you can only upload images, and only graphic designers use it. The stuff that gets shared there is very cool, and is great inspiration for my own freelance work.

The similarities between my idea and Dribbble end at “designers uploading pictures”. Whereas Dribbble is a social tool to showcase your work, I want to build an app that lets a designer upload two competing drafts of a design at once and let users choose their favorite.

While it’s easy enough to [A/B test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) a [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface), many non-UI designs choices such as art styles aren’t easy to justify with data. You often end up with a [back-and-forth discussion/passive-aggressive argument](http://justinmezzell.com/blog/2013/8/8/the-feedback-loop) between designer and client about what works best. And usually, neither side actually can *prove* their point. This is far from ideal.

I’m a big believer in using data to guide decisions. So my app would let designers decide on two (potentially more) directions for a piece, submit them, and see how random viewers judge them. I think it would be good to allow a limited description of the design’s goal, such as “spooky” or “high-tech” or “playful”, so that viewers know what the designer’s goal is and can judge accordingly. With this app, a designer could acquire greater knowledge of others’ preferences and help guide clients to better designs with data.

Creating this app depends on my ability to program it. I think it would be somewhat easy to build a prototype of this in something like Rails or Django. And this app could potentially be profitable! I’m sure if it got big, I’d need to hire someone who knows what they’re doing. But I could possibly experiment by myself.

The other trick would be building a broad enough user base such that people actually get feedback on designs. While Dribbble makes successful use of social features, I think that would actually get in the way here. Dribbble’s “likes” accumulate largely to the rockstar designers, which is fine for showing off good work but bad when you want every work seen by a minimum number of eyeballs. It would probably have to be somewhat random, like those “hot or not” websites. But I think these are solvable problems.

## Styolmetic Scrambler App

Recently, J. K. Rowling was outed as the author of *The Cuckoo’s Calling*. While the story broke due to a leaked secret, [it was verified by statistical analysis](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5315) of the book compared to the Harry Potter series. Certain patterns of style were algorithmically identified and matched to Rowling’s known works.

This practice is called stylometry, and it can be used for purposes beyond revealing pseudonymous best-sellers. Stylometry can be used to identify the author of a written work with decent accuracy, based entirely on unique patterns of speech that the author is not consciously aware of using. [One such technique identified a previously anonymous author of some of the Federalist Papers as James Madison](http://toolingup.stanford.edu/?page_id=201).

Stylometry could also be used to attribute authorship where anonymity is both desired and crucial. Imagine a dissent publishing a manifesto (*pro-tip: nobody should ever title anything a manifesto*) and ending up in prison because stylometry software identified him as the author. The importance of anonymity in crafting effective criticisms of powerful institutions is paramount. Helping authors identify their own writing patterns and masking them could be a useful tool.

My idea is to create and app—probably something that only runs client-side for security reasons—that scans a written work for differences from stylometric averages and helps the author mask their stylometric fingerprint. It could suggest synonyms, equivalent phrases, or merely tell the author “you use adverbs too much”. However it functions, it could be a useful tool for the politically disenfranchised to spread their message with greater anonymity.

That said, it’s a tool that could potentially be abused by college students trying to write plagiarized essays. That’s a risk I’m willing to take.

The greater challenge is learning enough programming and statistics to build the app, and compiling enough information to both identify unique patterns and correct them. Unlike the previous app idea, I don’t know that I can build this. I may need lots of help. This is an app that I believe must be built eventually, as oppressive institutions are sure to adopt stylometric analysis. I’m only concerned about my own ability to manufacture it.

There’s probably not much profitability in a project like this. Maybe it could also be kickstarted. Probably should just be released with an open source license.

## Multidisciplinary “Hackerspace” for Libertarians in DC

One problem I’ve had personally since leaving college is finding the best way to learn new skills. In college we had a library with all kinds of A/V equipment, a Comp Sci department with cool hardware, and all other types of sophisticated machines and software freely available to students who needed/wanted it. Now that I’m working, my only chance to use fun, new, prohibitively expensive hardware is through my employer. And since they are, as previously mentioned, a nonprofit, they don’t have that much stuff to learn to use in the first place.

So, say I want to learn about professional film making? Better shell out a couple grand for a camera and accessories and a nice Mac to edit with, because there’s not much in the office and it’s not your job to use it anyway. Want to figure out how 3D printing works? Same deal, especially since no DC-area liberty group would ever care to buy one. I could go on.

I have two hypotheses: first, that I am not the only one who misses easy/cheap access to lots of cool/expensive tools with which to learn and build new skills and create new projects; second, that given the chance to go to a workshop or [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) to use tools not normally available, people will actually do it.

So my ideas is a kind of workshop, geared toward DC libertarians (because that’s just who I know and love), where people can come together to learn new technologies/skills, share knowledge, have meetings and social events, and generally take their freedom-fighting game to the next level. I’m not aware of any existing supportive institution like this (unless you count [Leadership Institute](http://www.leadershipinstitute.org/), which I don’t for various reasons), and I think it could really empower local libertarians to improve their abilities and innovate the ways they advance libertarian ideas and policies.

This idea is doubtlessly the most expensive so far, and I would have to fundraise a lot to pull it off. I think first, I would need to verify that this market of people like myself really does exist. Then I would need to lease/buy space (my preference is toward the latter, but that’s a stretch) and lots of tech goodies to fill it with: powerful Macs, a 3D printer, fancy cameras, and whatever other goodies I can figure out. Rough guess, I’d need $30,000-$50,000 per year to run this if renting, much more if buying. There’s already a non-ideological hackerspace in DC, and I should talk to some of those folks to get a better idea.

I do have some anecdotal evidence that people are interested in broadening their skills in the fight for liberty. I was a successful co-host of a digital cryptography for libertarians workshop the other weekend which had good and active attendance, and I hope to do another one in the future. I see this liberty hackerspace as an institutionalization of an informal workshop like that, where anyone can come together to learn or teach and have all the resources available.

This is an idea that really excites me, but would be very hard to achieve. I’m not even sure where to begin. But it you like this idea too, I’d be happy to hear your ideas and advice to pulling it off.

## Affordable Housing for Libertarian Activists

The previous idea was a bit crazy and certainly expensive. This idea makes that one seem cheap and reasonable.

One thing that makes me want to quit my job and leave DC forever is the extremely high cost of living here. Rent is ridiculous, and made no better by the fact that I earn a nonprofit salary. I think there’s a good reason that most of my friends in the liberty movement inside the Beltway are non-married, living in shared housing with 3 to 4 other people. (That’s not just poor, straight-out-of-college folks; it includes lawyers, vice presidents, and C-level people.) I’m the odd one, living in a single studio with my wife. That’s even more expensive. Right now, I’m stuck in an apartment I hate because I can’t afford anything else. I can’t be the only one.

I often wonder how much talent the liberty movement loses because it’s just so difficult to live and work in DC at nonprofit salaries. The easy solution is to start paying everyone a market salary, but, let’s face it, [that won’t happen](/nonprofits-must-embrace-the-labor-market/).

So, what’s the second-best solution? In my opinion, buy a big apartment building and rent it out cheap to young/poor libertarian activists who are working in the movement.

I’ve tried researching housing law to figure out how this would work, but honestly I haven’t even figured out how I, as an individual, would successfully buy a condo. I would need help from lawyers who understand residential real estate. I imagine it would be tricky to restrict this good deal just to libertarians, too.

But I have no doubt that, somewhere out there, there are designated houses that have been used exclusively by ideological activists over the years. I know, because I’ve been in a few, though none for libertarians. There are a few “liberty houses” in the area, but these are usually no more than 5 libertarians who choose to live together, still paying high rent for properties they don’t actually own. I think about the friendships, the networking, and the sharing of ideas and projects that happens at these houses, and wonder, “What if you multiplied that by 50?” With an entire apartment/condo building dedicated to supporting the movement, you could house many more libertarians, generate more/better ideas to advance liberty, and for less of the activists’ salaries.

I believe it’s a viable market, but the initial fundraising would be nearly impossible. It would require many millions to buy a building large enough, and to hire lawyers to figure out how to make it all legal and what tax status the organization should use. This idea leaves me completely baffled on where to begin. Seriously, not a clue. It may never happen. Still, if you think this sounds cool too, let’s talk.
