A bit over a year ago, I shared [my resolutions for 2014](http://tomvanantwerp.com/resolved/). And what would be the point of publicly sharing them if I weren’t also publicly accountable? So here’s my 2014 year in review:

* **Programming**: I wanted to practice programming more, and I’ve certainly done it. I’ve learned much more than I knew previously, especially about JavaScript. I’ve built [interactive](http://tomvanantwerp.com/us-companies-foreign-taxes-visualized-d3/) [graphics](http://tomvanantwerp.com/mapping-corporate-tax-rates-purchasing-power/) for work and fulfilled my childhood dream of making my own video game. I’ll only keep learning in 2015. I have lots of projects, both at work and personally, that I can’t wait to share!
* **Graphic Design**: Goal 1 has made Goal 2 difficult. It was easier to make time for design and building a freelance business before working at the Tax Foundation. I have no complaints, however; it’s been more than a fair trade. I hope I can make more time for this in 2015, but programming comes first.
* **Physical Fitness**: 2014 was a wash in terms of fitness. My weight fluctuated quite a bit, but ended about where it began. I think that my weight gain/loss roughly correlates with my moods and feelings of productivity throughout the year. I’ll have to go back through lots of documentation to be sure about that. But my subjective opinion is that I go through almost manic-depressive cycles where I’m either amazing at everything or falling behind at everything. My weight over the course of 2014 shows some potential cycles. The inflection points where weight loss transitions to weight gain are very sharp, and I’ll have to see what might have caused that.

* **Liberty**: I’m not sure how to judge my performance on this. My work on a daily basis usually doesn’t translate to direct advocacy for a freer society. And to some extent, I like that about it. Nearly a month ago, I ran into some friends at a Christmas party and we talked about our libertarianism. We all agreed on three things: 1) it was an exhilarating time when we first discovered libertarian thought and had wanted to discuss it; 2) we’re still very libertarian with only minor changes to our views over time; 3) we’re really not interested in talking about it anymore, and would rather think about a nice new furniture set or the balances of our 401(k)s. I still believe that societies that promote individual liberty will be more peaceful, prosperous, and happy than those that don’t. I still want to do something to promote liberty in my own society. But I’m also getting tired, and wondering what I can really do anymore. Perhaps I’ll find a way in 2015 to rekindle that old excitement and channel it more productively.
