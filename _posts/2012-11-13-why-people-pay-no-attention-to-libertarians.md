Aaron Ross Powell makes the case at Libertarianism.org that [the advice of libertarians should be taken seriously](http://www.libertarianism.org/blog/why-people-should-pay-more-attention-libertarians) due to the typical psychological profile of libertarians. [Research by Jonathan Haidt and others](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0042366) indicates that libertarians are more cerebral than most, and tend toward dispassionate analysis rather than emotion-driven instincts.

The validity of Haidt’s findings aside (the conclusions seem intuitively accurate, but the methods of reaching them don’t satisfy me), I wonder if this really is a good reason to trust libertarians with decision-marking more than others. Yes, perhaps our analysis is more dispassionate. But [emotional intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence) is equally required to make good decisions when working with people. Haidt’s work would indicate that libertarians are emotionally retarded by comparison to liberals or conservatives.

In Aaron’s hypothetical scenario, three consultants— Adam the conservative, Barney the liberal, and Charles the libertarian—offer plans to turn around a failing business. Aaron argues that the deference to authority on part of the conservative and over-concern with fairness by the liberal will bias them against making hard but necessary decisions. The libertarian, with his systematic thinking style and natural disdain for existing authority, will have the most unbiased understanding of the organization and how to fix it.

Each of these consultants has placed their recommendations into sealed envelopes. Let’s take this analogy one step further than Aaron has, and open the envelopes.

Adam the conservative consultant might say:

> Some executives should be offered generous [golden parachutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_parachute) to leave. Lower-level employees who aren’t adding much value should be terminated.

Barney the liberal consultant might say:

> Employees who aren’t performing up to expectations should receive special job training or be transferred to roles more suiting their skills. Executives should take a pay cut until the company turns around.

Charles the libertarian consultant might say:

> The company fails to make use of market principles. Knowledge processes are lacking; employees must deliver clearly measurable results. The employees will be reviewed based on these measurements quarterly, and under-performers will be terminated. Decision rights are also badly allocated between employees and management; executives must relinquish some control to encourage the use of local knowledge by employees. The entire company needs to change it’s culture to conform to these [five dimensions and ten guiding principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_G._Koch#Market-Based_Management) of effective management.

The conservative and the liberal both offer solutions that address the needs of people. Respecting authority, the conservative suggests a way to move ineffective senior people out without feeling like they’ve been cheated. The liberal offers a plan for improving the skills of current employees, reassuring them that they aren’t about to lose their jobs and making them more valuable to the company. Both offer some hard choices (layoffs and pay cuts), but both also recognize the emotional needs of some of the stakeholders. The company isn’t just a system to them, but it’s a group of people. To create lasting change with minimal resistance, stakeholders must be treated as the human beings they are.

The libertarian throws out theory and buzzwords and doesn’t address the emotional needs of any actual human beings whatsoever. He sees the system, but only the system. The ideas presented aren’t bad, and at least one “Charles the libertarian” uses them to [great effect](http://www.kochind.com/). But his presentation ignores the personal elements involved in change. Employees will experience increased emotional strain from measuring and justifying their positions every quarter. Management will probably be resistant to giving up the level of control they already have. [And nobody ever wants to read Atlas Shrugged.](http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/150385/plucked)

To quote [Theodore Roosevelt](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/theodorero140484.html), “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.” This is why libertarians usually aren’t taken seriously. Being right doesn’t matter if we can’t relate to other people. Libertarians are viewed as [snobby, aloof, or outright weird](http://leftycartoons.com/the-24-types-of-libertarian/). It’s not a great way to [win friends and influence people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People). Libertarians can make very good, very thoughtful arguments for why their ideas are right. And in the process, they continually fail to address emotional resistance to those arguments. A libertarian’s ideas may be correct, but implementing them outright will probably just piss everybody off.

Libertarian [hyper-rationality](http://bigthink.com/ideas/hyper-rationality?page=all) is as much a weakness as it is a strength.
