Today I’ve published two new interactive maps for the [Tax Foundation](http://taxfoundation.org/). [First](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/map-united-states-has-one-highest-corporate-tax-rates-world), a map of the top marginal corporate tax rates across the world. [Second](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-metropolitan-areas), a map showing purchasing power across US metropolitan areas. The code and data for both maps can be found at the [Tax Foundation’s GitHub page](https://github.com/TaxFoundation).

I’ve still got some refactoring and outright rewriting to do before I’m happy with how I make these maps, but things have come along well. While I’m proud of my work so far, I recognize that I’m still learning and have lots of room for improvement. If you’ve got any comments or contributions to make to the code, feel free to work with me through GitHub.
