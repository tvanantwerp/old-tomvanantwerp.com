I’m writing this in response to Randy Barnett’s piece in the Wall Street Journal: [The Mistake That Is the Libertarian Party](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203922804578080684214526670.html). He argues that a vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson will only siphon votes away from Mitt Romney, who is at least marginally better than Barack Obama.

I can’t argue with Randy that the Libertarian Party itself is totally nuts. They almost elected [nobody](http://reason.com/blog/2012/05/05/anarchy-at-the-libertarian-party-convent) as their national committee chair. [This guy](http://reason.com/blog/2012/05/06/oh-hey-starchild) now sits on that committee. They try their damnedest to remain totally irrelevant.

But I disagree with his conclusion that  a vote for Mitt Romney and the Republican Party is a sensible libertarian choice. I don’t see Mitt as better than Barack, even at the margin. I’m young, and my political ideas were formed in the post-9/11 years. I watched a crappy Republican president wage war, trample civil liberties, and expend the scope and power of government for about 8 years. These past 4 years, I watched a Democrat do the same thing. Maybe Randy can remember a Republican Party that didn’t suck as bad as the Democrats, but I can’t tell the difference.

Also, even if the Republican Party were slightly better (it’s not), this isn’t—as Randy rightly observes—a parliamentary system. While there are some Republicans like Rand Paul who lean libertarian (versus approximately no Democrats I can think of), I cannot vote for the Republican Party writ-large. This year I voted for individual candidates, and I saw no sensible libertarian-leaning Republicans on my ballot.

So I voted for Gary Johnson, the individual candidate who comes closest to representing my views. I doubt my vote, representing 0.000015% of North Carolina’s registered voters, will swing this election either way. And I’m certainly not about to throw my life away in the service of the Libertarian Party by casting one vote for one candidate this one time.

Nor will a libertarian’s vote for a Libertarian prevent them from working with the Republicans, or the Democrats, or whoever. Why not? It’s a secret ballot! Maybe coming out publicly for Johnson ruins my political future, but plenty of other Libertarian voters are free to push the Republicans and the Democrats toward libertarian ideas. And when their fixer-upper party of choice loses by half a percent, they can still say: “I told you that the libertarians matter.”

I’m not conceited enough to believe that I can vote “strategically” and expect it to matter. All I can really hope for is that my vote, and every other vote Gary Johnson “steals” from today’s loser (as if he owned those votes to begin with), sends a message to the major parties: ignoring and ridiculing libertarians will cost them elections. Being marginally better than completely awful isn’t good enough.
