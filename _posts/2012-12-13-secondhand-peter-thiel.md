I’ve started reading through Blake Masters’ [notes on Peter Thiel’s start-up course](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) at Stanford in Spring 2012. So far, it’s very interesting stuff. Peter Thiel’s reputation as an entrepreneur, investor, and fellow libertarian is well earned. These course notes are giving me more insight into the way he thinks, and how very different it is from the models I often see applied toward libertarian social entrepreneurship.

There are plenty of good bits here, and I’ll likely share many of them. But first I want to examine this paragraph from section 5:

> Most startups are run by non-zero sum people. They believe world is cornucopian. That’s good. But even these people tend to pick competitive, warring fields because they don’t know any better. So they get slaughtered. The nerds just don’t realize that they’ve decided to fight a war until it’s all over.

Reading this passage, I thought of the Liberty Movement. Libertarians constantly emphasize that the free market is positive-sum, and should be embraced. And many libertarian activists, like the nerds above, are themselves positive-sum thinkers. And that is definitely a good thing.

But, politics is obviously a zero-sum (or perhaps negative-sum) game. To be politically successful requires fighting. It requires winning those fights. Very, very many libertarians choose to work outside of the political arena and focus on education. Quoting [Liana Gamber Thompson’s recent study of young libertarians](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/young-disillusioned-libertarians/):

> Interestingly, the majority of participants in this study spoke of disavowing electoral politics completely. While libertarian-leaning candidates like Ron Paul have gained momentum in recent years, a number of participants identified themselves as categorical non-voters, choosing to focus on educating others about liberty-related issues rather than investing in party politics.

Libertarians seem to be avoiding the zero-sum political game in favor of something with positive-sum potential. Unfortunately, as Thiel via Masters notes:

> The problem with company [sic] made up of nothing but nerds is that it will ignore the fact that there may be situations where you have to fight. So when those situations arise, the nerds will be crushed by their own naiveté.

Most libertarians don’t like fighting. We are nerds, more interested in sharing ideas than crushing the opposition. But the political system we so despise isn’t set up that way. It’s an environment where success means victory over the opponent. And success in this system is  necessary to scale back government intrusion into our lives. It’s not ideal. It’s not clean or good or desirable. But it’s the hand we’ve been dealt, and pretending otherwise won’t save us.

Thiel’s insight applied to the Liberty Movement is this: Libertarian nerds must recognize that we’ve gotten into a war with the statist jocks. [We’ve got to beat them at their own game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDdbg_Q-LMI), or we’ll never get the chance to live the positive-sum lives we really want.

**Bonus**: I got the chance to briefly interview Peter Thiel at the 2012 International Students For Liberty Conference. Check it out!
