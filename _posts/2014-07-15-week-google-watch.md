I already shared my [initial impressions](/watch/), but I wanted to write down an in-depth account of living with my Samsung Gear Live running Android Wear after the first week. I do enjoy my new watch, but it definitely has room for improvement.

There are lots of things I love about this watch, with the ability to set reminders being the biggest. It’s easy to tell my watch to remind me to do a thing at a time, and then it does. Using reminders on the watch is easier than on my phone, which I’d have to unlock and navigate through each time I got a new notification. Now I just feel a vibration, look at my watch, and know, “Oh, I need to water the plants before I leave for work!”

I also enjoy how easy it is to control music on my phone from my watch. If I run into someone while listening on my headphones, I can quickly tap pause on my watch to stop the music. I can start it again just as easily.

As for things I don’t like, the experience isn’t as effortless as I hoped. Nearly 90% of the time my watch lights up in response to arm movement, it’s a false alarm. And maybe 40% of the time I really am trying to use my watch, it doesn’t recognize my movement correctly.

While I’ve loved controlling my music from the watch, it’s annoying to see those same music controls still hovering at the bottom of the watch face hours after I paused playback—even if I swiped the card away. I think this is the fault of the apps themselves, not the watch, but it’s annoying nonetheless.

I’ve also had trouble getting the heart rate monitor to work after working out. If I climb 10 flights of stairs and try to take a reading, my watch tells me “Just a sec…” and never shows me anything else until I swipe the card away. I can only ever know my resting heart rate, making my watch useless for workouts.

And of course, it’s still awkward to talk into my wrist when I’m around other people. That is going to take getting used to.

I don’t regret getting my smartwatch. I expect many of the bugs and annoyances to be ironed out with time. In the mean time, I remember a wise piece of IT advice I once received: “You trade your old bugs for new bugs, and hope to come out better on net.”
