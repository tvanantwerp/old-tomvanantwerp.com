[In my last post](/returns-leisure/), I outlined my plan to track my leisure time for two weeks (I’m roughly 75% through) in order to see how much fun I can get out of money spent on different activities. My hope was that I could better choose how I spend future leisure time by identifying the costs associated with past leisure time and how much enjoyment those costs purchased.

I’m still collecting data and I haven’t reviewed cost figures yet, but one point of data already leaps out: video games.

In the past 10 days, I have played over 40 hours worth of video games. I’m basically working a second full-time job and paying for the privilege.

This is a bit anomalous. I’ve only recently started playing video games again after several years of avoiding them. I knew from high school and before that I like video games a bit too much. But while these past 10 days don’t reflect the past few months or years, they are a reminder one of my weaknesses.

Truth is, I’m addicted to playing video games. The data seem pretty clear on that. When I play games, I enter a state of [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). I can spend hours playing without tiring. And I really, truly enjoy it.

Being a video game addict isn’t the worst addiction a man could have. But spending a full 25% of my waking hours staring at the TV while I unproductively twitch my thumbs still isn’t good.

While I knew I had a video game addiction, quantifying it certainly helps to put it into perspective. Games may give me the most leisure hours per dollar, but the opportunity cost of such addiction is quite high.

I think I need to unplug.
