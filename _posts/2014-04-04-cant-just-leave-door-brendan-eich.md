A few days ago, I didn’t know who [Brendan Eich](https://brendaneich.com/) was. Now I know that he created [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [gave $1,000](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/04/business/la-fi-tn-brendan-eich-prop-8-contribution-20120404) in support of [California’s Proposition 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_8), and was [Mozilla’s CEO for 11 days](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/).

After becoming CEO, many protested online against Mozilla’s choice of Eich. Most widely reported, [OKCupid](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26830383) warned visitors using Firefox that Eich opposed equal rights for same sex couples and encouraged them to switch browsers. Eich never offered a public explanation or defense of his donation or his views. In the end, he resigned.

Given his record, Eich probably could’ve been a great CEO for Mozilla. But his technical knowledge and contributions haven’t excused his political support for outlawing gay marriage in California, and for good reason.

A CEO is a very different thing from a CTO, Eich’s former position. A CEO must be the public face of a company. The CEO gives an organization a voice and a personality. In his short tenure as CEO, Eich proved that he wasn’t up to the task.

When confronted by employees and the wary public, Eich simply refused to discuss his actions. He stated his firm belief in leaving personal opinions at the door. And that’s fine, when personal opinions refers to favorite sports team or preferred brand of automobile.

When Eich gave $1,000 in support of Proposition 8, he was publicly supporting a law designed to prevent gay couples from marrying each other. This is a law that affected many Californians, including Mozilla employees. And while many of these employees note that they’ve never seen signs of discrimination by Eich in the workplace, they’ve got to be hesitant to work for a man who materially contributed toward a law that stripped them of their rights.

Hampton Catlin’s account (Catlin is himself no tech lightweight) [tells a pretty clear story of Eich’s failure of leadership](http://www.teamrarebit.com/blog/2014/04/03/a-sad-victory/):

> I met with Brendan and asked him to just apologize for the discrimination under the law that we faced. He can still keep his personal beliefs, but I wanted him to recognize that we faced real issues with immigration and say that he never intended to cause people problems.
>
> It’s heartbreaking to us that he was unwilling to say even that.
>
> …
>
> People think we were upset about his past vote. Instead we were more upset with his current and continued unwillingness to discuss the issue with empathy. Seriously, we assumed that he would reconsider his thoughts on the impact of the law (**not** his personal beliefs), issue an apology, and then he’d go on to be a great CEO.
>
> The fact it ever went this far is really disturbing to us.

The problem wasn’t that Eich “exercised his First Amendment rights” as so many defenders like to frame it, but that he remorselessly advocated for a law that had very real negative impacts on people. There’s no leaving that at the door.

I’ve been very surprised by the reactions from a lot of libertarians during this kerfuffle.  Eich tried to limit the rights of homosexual couples in California by way of government. In response to this vile and clearly statist act, ordinary people peacefully organized against him. They made clear their objections to his leadership, and did not use any form of physical force to oust him from Mozilla. This, in my mind, is exactly how bigotry ought to be handled by libertarians. Reliance on the government to oppress others who have done you no physical harm is unacceptable, and anyone who tries it should be publicly shamed.

And yet, libertarian reactions I’ve seen have mostly criticized the “mob” for enforcing political correctness and silencing a man’s free speech. I’m completely baffled by that interpretation of events. (I’m [not the only one to notice](http://www.politicalgarbagechute.com/libertarians-love-the-free-market-apparently-until-it-acts-freely/) the contradiction.)

[Conor Friedersdorf](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/mozillas-gay-marriage-litmus-test-violates-liberal-values/360156/) says that, hey, this all happened a few years ago and Prop 8 was overturned and he seems like a nice man, so what’s the big deal? [Nick Gillespie](http://time.com/49136/brendan-eich-mozilla-firing-firefox-gay-marriage/) of Reason seems mostly annoyed that now he has to wonder if his choice of web browser supports homophobes. Lot’s of libertarians I call friends echo these sentiments or worse on social media.

We’re not talking about a guy who said offhandedly, “I don’t care for gay marriage very much, but whatever–I’ll still work with gay folks.” This is a guy who dropped a grand to make gay marriage illegal. He wasn’t expressing a private opinion, but *acting* toward the restriction of gay couples’ rights.

If I were an LGBT employee at Mozilla, I would have a damn hard time respecting a boss who tried to outlaw my marriage to the person I loved, and who refuses to acknowledge the harm that caused me. No amount of professional courtesy at the office would make up for that.

I hope that Eich comes to believe that he acted wrongly, and feels remorse for throwing in with those who would strip gay couples of their equal rights.

I also hope that libertarians can cut it out with the knee-jerk reactions to always support CEOs and be critical of any minority group that might possibly be liberal. So many libertarians are guilty of the same [lack of empathy](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/mozilla-is-human/) that Eich himself displayed. Nobody cares what you know until they know that you care. Eich and a lot of libertarians will continue to learn this lesson the hard way…
