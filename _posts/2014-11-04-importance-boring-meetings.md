I recently read a blog post at 99U calling for the [death of status meetings](http://99u.com/workbook/33875/kill-the-dreaded-status-meeting). The author argues that they are nothing more than boring time-wasters where everyone waits for their turn to talk and zones out the rest of the time. I would agree with much of that statement, except for the claim that they are time wasters. They may be dull, but they serve a vital purpose for teams and organizations. Without them, you should expect ignorance and chaos.

The Tax Foundation has daily 2-3 minute status meetings, and one hour-long all-staff meeting on Mondays. Thanks to these meetings, I always feel like I know what’s going on. The goals and direction of the organization are clear, as is everyone’s place within it. I know who is doing what, and how I might be able to help them. And knowing that I’m accountable to the group to tell them my plans each day forces me to actually make those plans. Yeah, sometimes it’s boring. But it works, and I would never want to abolish it.

At a previous employer, there were no status meetings for all staff. I very rarely knew who was working on what. Once, I learned about a new major initiative only when I saw it announced on our public website. Another time I was helping with the annual audit, and we were trying to make sure special project money was accounted for. I was asked, “How much money did we get for Project X?” I could only respond: “Project X? What’s that?” The name Project X is a pseudonym, of course. But it was a project which I instantly knew was a big deal (other organizations had similar large projects), one that I needed to know about, and which no one had told me we were doing.

A few minutes of my time each day to share what I’m working on and to learn what others are doing is a very small price to pay. Having seen the alternative, I’m happy to endure sometimes boring status meetings to make sure everyone is in-the-loop rather than the dark.
