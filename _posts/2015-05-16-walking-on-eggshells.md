Writing this blog post has been very uncomfortable for me, which is why I know I need to publish it.

[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a federal agency that aims to improve the technical capabilities of the US government, recently released their own [code of conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). I have looked up to 18F for quite some time as one of the few government agencies that seems to be trying hard to do things well. They embrace 21st century technology with the goal of making government more functional. Sometimes I would think to myself, "If I ever leave the think tank world, maybe I would work somewhere like 18F." But reading this code of conduct gives me considerable pause.

## Gut Reactions

Before getting to my qualms with this code of conduct, I acknowledge that I believe 18F was trying their best to outline positive cultural norms for their organization. Getting culture right is both very hard and very important. I applaud their efforts to make that happen, particularly at a government agency.

However, from the moment I read 18F's code of conduct, I felt extremely uncomfortable. They spend only 86 words talking about [empowering](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md#be-empowering) people, but write 348 words about the [boundaries](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md#boundaries) you ought to erect between yourself and your peers. The first line talks about "Creating a Culture of Innovation", but the bulk of the document was a laundry list of things I ought not ever consider doing.

And sure, lots of those actions **are** things I ought not do: racism, sexism, and other obviously horrible forms of discrimination. But it keeps going, and going, to the point that basically making anyone even a little uncomfortable for whatever reason is *verboten*. Interrupt too much at meetings? Don't do it; you're making life hard on the introverts. Could another coworker think you sounded patronizing just now? Uh oh, now you're in trouble! Maybe the boss has some unconstructive criticism along the lines of "I don't know, it just doesn't feel right. It's not there yet." He's micro-aggressing you. You might summarize the code thus: "Don't ever do anything that could result in another person feeling uncomfortable."

**Bad behaviors such as sexual harassment are quite obviously terrible and completely unacceptable.** Those actions ought to be discouraged and, if they occur, punished swiftly. It's the sort of thing which should ideally be covered by the phrase, "You're a grown-up; act like one." Not exactly ironclad legalese, but I think most of us can appreciate the sentiment.

But there are other bad behaviors that aren't so malicious. I'm just a guy, and I say stupid things sometimes without realizing how stupid they are before I can stop myself. I try to be better than "just a guy", but I'd be lying if I didn't admit my constant failures. Sometimes I'm cranky, because maybe I haven't had my coffee yet, or because you're the third person to break my coding flow this morning, or maybe I'm still irritable because the Metro was [on fire](http://ismetroburning.com/) *again*. I can try my best to act in good faith and still fail. Reading 18F's code of conduct, I felt sure that I would inevitably violate it by simple accident.

## Checking Privilege

I am a straight white American male. That's *a lot* of privilege to check. Was my reaction merely some deep-seated fear of losing my ability to leverage the patriarchy to my exclusive advantage? (By the way, I have no idea how to do that, so anyone with experience milking the patriarchy for all it's worth should totally mentor me.)

To get some perspective, I asked my wife [Valerie](http://kitszeho.com) to read this code of conduct. She in an immigrant, an ethnic minority, and a woman. She ranks pretty low on the American privilege scale. I didn't want to bias her, so all I said to her was to please read this and tell me what you think about it.

Valerie confirmed my suspicions that, yes, this code of conduct had problems. Her first remark was that the code was vague. I asked her, "How so?". Boundaries, in her view, were poorly defined. It wasn't at all clear how you could actually avoid crossing these nebulous boundaries. She said that the authors must expect everyone to be a god to comply with the perfect ideals outlined within. Valerie actually asked me, "Is this the law?" She was relieved when I told her, no, this document does not have the force of law.

I asked Valerie to read this not only because of her non-privileged status, but because one of the big no-nos in the code of conduct is something that she does all of the time.

> Referring to people in a way that misidentifies their gender and/or rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).

[Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese), which is my wife's native tongue, does not have gendered pronouns. As a result, she *frequently* screws up "he" and "she". To me, it's just an annoyance; I must constantly ask which person in her stories is actually being referred to, or else I get lost. But if Valerie were in this work environment, her harmless second language mistake would become an HR *faux pas*.

I asked others to read this code of conduct too. Many of them helped me see how some people could experience problems that I never would (e.g., older male employees flirting with young interns). But all of them thought as I had that the ideals of 18F's code were impossible to live up to 100%.

## It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness

One important line (emphasis theirs) from the code reads:

> **Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.**

This is true. When I hear coworkers talk about sports, for example, I feel alienated. I don't watch sports, don't understand the appeal of sports, and I definitely don't know the players' names. I have no part to play in those conversations.

*But that's OK.*

I value the fact that my coworkers are different from me! Through conversations with them, I get to experience new things. I've learned about parts of America and the world that I've never seen. I've delved into hobbies and subcultures that I would not have discovered on my own. My older coworkers have exposed me to past events and pop culture that I would otherwise have never known. Each one of my coworkers is an amazing *individual*, and I'm very grateful to work beside them and to learn from their *unique* experiences.

So maybe I feel a little out-of-the-loop during sports time. Some folks probably feel the same when I nerd-out over a video game or some arcane technology topic. I don't expect to feel 100% comfortable all of the time, and I don't think they do either. We're committed to organizational and personal growth, and we're willing to step outside our comfort zones to do that.

We all work hard, and crunch time can take its toll. If a coworker was mean to us on Friday, it may just be because he's been stressed by a major project all week and that he'll be fine by Monday. Forgiveness is a given.

What unnerves me about 18F's approach to conflict resolution is that any perceived slight is all my fault, whether I meant to slight someone or not. And while I agree that we are responsible for our own interactions with people, accepting that truth does not translate into perfect adherence. Sometimes the best we can do is to admit our mistakes after the fact. I'm comfortable knowing that, when ignorance, fatigue, or absent-mindedness leads me to act badly toward a colleague, I can apologize to them and they will likely understand. 18F's code of conduct makes me think that I would spend a career there in constant fear of committing an accidental offense.

## Celebrate Differences

From 18F's code, I agree strongly with this line:

> Problems happen when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm or ok with everyone.

The thing is, you're never going to fix those problems by sticking to those assumptions.

Interpersonal conflict that is non-malicious can arise from a failure to make assumptive norms explicit. Every **big** argument I've ever had with my wife (again, she's not an American) has been the result of just such a situation. Neither of us acted in bad faith toward each other, but we became angry at each other because our beliefs of how things were supposed to be didn't align. Our differing beliefs were so ingrained in our cultural experiences that we didn't realize another viewpoint was possible. To the extent that we've tried to make our beliefs more explicit, we've resolved and prevented many arguments.

I've seen the same problem arise professionally. People with different day-to-day duties, different personal interests, and different social circles, have come into conflict because neither could fully see and understand the other's position. Words that meant one thing to the one party had another definition for the other. Concerns that were obvious to one were hidden to the other. These situations require setting aside ego and earnestly engaging with your differences to find out where the miscommunication is happening. Any attempt to ignore the differences inherent to these colleagues' lives will only prolong and worsen conflict.

We're all just people, and we frequently fail. Sometimes we are offensive without ever consciously choosing to be so. Each of us has to choose, should we be welcome offense or build resilience? I believe that I and my colleagues have chosen the latter, and it makes me glad. I hope 18F will too.

I'd like to close with a quote from a [recent letter by Andrew W.K.](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2015/05/ask_andrew_wk_im_offended_should_i_get_rid_of_the_offender.php):

> There will always be things that can offend us. There will always be ways for us to associate otherwise innocent experiences with something sinister and disturbing. We can always find a way to connect the dots that lead us into darkness. We can always allow something to set off an avalanche of bad feelings because something is different than what we prefer. We will always have an endless amount of ways to get our feelings hurt. Even the word "feeling" could eventually remind us of all our other bad memories and hurt feelings. Without discounting the very real and painful experiences we can encounter in life, we know that our ultimate goal is to be thoughtful and strong. And if we're truly committed and determined enough, even our most upsetting life experiences can embolden our spirit and cause us to expand, not shrivel and escape into a non-feeling, non-experiencing state. Even though life will push our buttons and give us every reason to turn away from it, we must realize that deep down inside, turning away from the life is just letting the darkness win. The best way to triumph over hardship is to force ourselves back into the light.
