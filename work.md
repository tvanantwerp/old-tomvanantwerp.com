* [Alea](http://tomvanantwerp.com/alea)
Random password generator based on the Diceware technique, written in JavaScript. More details in [this blog post](http://tomvanantwerp.com/make-passwords-easy-to-remember-hard-to-guess/).
* [Chart Book Generator](https://github.com/TaxFoundation/chartbook)
A Jekyll-powered static site generator for building what the [Tax Foundation](http://taxfoundation.org/) calls "chart books". Imagine a cross between [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/)'s card stacks and their *N Charts that Explain X* listicles.
* [Falling Upwards](http://tomvanantwerp.com/ludum-dare-30/web/falling-upwards.html)
My first ever video game, created for [Ludum Dare 30](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=38872). Challenged myself to learn enough of Unity3D in two weeks to build something from scratch in 48 hours. It's a short game, but I hope you enjoy it!
* [Tax Foundation Data](https://github.com/TaxFoundation/data)
I didn't generate all of this data, of course; but I did format it for publication in a Github repo and document it thoroughly.
* [Tax Foundation Excel Bootcamp](https://github.com/TaxFoundation/excel-training/blob/master/excel-training.md)
Basic training course for Tax Foundation interns to get them up to speed with collecting and cleaning data in Microsoft Excel. Includes animated GIFs!
